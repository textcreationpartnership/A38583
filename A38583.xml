            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>es to all voluntary obedience to the ſame Word, in which obedience conſiſts that Service, which is more acceptable with God than any Sacrifice outward; They, who come into Gods houſe, and ſpecial preſence there, to offer him a Sacrifice, and perform it in ſuch a groſs and rude manner, as that God will not, indeed cannot accept of it; they do as it were affront him in his own houſe, they offer him an abuſe before his face; they come to expreſs their folly, rather then to ſhew their devotion; they give him the Sacrifice of fools, and all for want of due conſideration: For they conſider not that they do evil. Now to correct all theſe errours and evils, which may be committed in the Service of God for want of due conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, (which are great evils, however little account we may make of them) I ſhall fix
<pb facs="tcp:51624:7"/>your conſiderations upon ſome few things very neceſſary to be thought upon, when ye are either going about, or are upon the Service of God.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> When ye are entring, conſider that ye are entring Gods houſe, and therefore keep your feet when ye enter, <hi>Eccleſ. 5.1.</hi> which words are a caution, commanding our care and our conſideration that we do not enter rudely, that we do not enter raſhly and unadviſedly: I or we are going into the houſe of God, whither we are to carry nothing along with us which may be diſpleaſing and offenſive unto that God, into whoſe houſe we are going. We are to look to our feet, that is, our paſſions and affections, which are as the feet and lower part of our ſouls. We are to undreg them of all earth, dirt and filth, that nothing which is earthly or ſenſual, may mingle with our ſpiritual imployments, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we are to be exerciſed, and wholly taken up during our ſtay in that Holy place. When <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Joſhua</hi> approached that ground, which the preſence of God by his Angel made holy, they were commanded to put off their ſhoes, <hi>Exod. 3.5. Joſh. 5.15.</hi> By which in a figure was intimated, the cleanſing of the ſoul from that filth of ſin, which is required of every one, who draws near unto God, <hi>Heb. 10.22.</hi> When our buſineſs is with God, we are to mind
<pb facs="tcp:51624:8"/>our buſineſs, to have our minds, hearts and affections ſet only upon it. When we come into the houſe of God, which is the figure of heaven, we are to leave the earth and the world behind us, and to have our converſation only in heaven. When <hi>Abraham</hi> went to ſacrifice, and to offer up the deareſt thing which he had, unto God, he left his Aſs and his Servants behind him, <hi>Gen. 22.5.</hi> And when holy <hi>Bernard</hi> entred the Temple, his uſual ſaying was, <hi>Stay behind all my worldly thoughts:</hi> So when we are to enter Gods houſe, and are making our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches to do him ſervice, we ſhould have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do with the world, but take off our hearts and affections clear from it. As we would keep our feet as much as poſſibly we can from dirt and filth, when we are to enter the Preſence-Chamber of a King; ſo when we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into Gods houſe, which is his Preſence-Chamber, we are to keep the feet of our ſouls clean, and unſpotted from the world, though not altogether clean, yet as clean as they can be kept. Like thoſe, who come out of the dirt, into a well-ſwept room, we muſt caſt away that filth and uncleanneſs, which we may have contracted in our worldly affairs, when we are entring into the houſe of God. <hi>Keep thy foot when thou entreſt;</hi> it is an expreſſion borrowed from the Heathens, eſpecially the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> who would not enter their Idol-Temples with
<pb facs="tcp:51624:8"/>ſhoes on their feet. And amongst his other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, <hi>Pythagoras</hi> gave this for one, <hi>When thou ſacrificeſt or worſhippeſt, put off thy ſhoes from thy feet.</hi> By which is intimated to us, who look not ſo much at the ceremony, as at the meaning of it, That when we come into Gods houſe, who is a God of purity, in whoſe preſence the brighteſt Angel is impure, we are to ſee that all be pure about us; we are to come with pure hearts, pure hands, and to preſent him with pure offerings; eſpecially we are to look to our affections, the feet of our ſouls, to ſee that they have contracted no impurity, for if they be pure, the whole man is pure; <hi>Keep thy foot when thou entreſt.</hi> This is the first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, which if well thought upon, would prevent many of thoſe rudeneſſes, evils and miſdemeanours, which unwiſe men raſhly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit in Gods houſe, and ſo offer to him the Sacrifice of fools, for want of due conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> When thou art entred the houſe of God, let thy next conſideration be, that thou art in the preſence of God, there where God is preſent in a more ſpecial and peculiar manner: He is every-where preſent by his Eſſence, which is infinite, and cannot be contained within bounds or limits: He is every-where preſent by his Power, turning the Orbs of Heaven with
<pb facs="tcp:51624:9"/>his hand, fixing the Earth with his foot, gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all Creatures with his eye, and refreſhing them all with his influence; but he is more ſpecially preſent in ſome places, than in other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, by the ſeveral and more ſpecial mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festations of himſelf to extraordinary purpoſes. Thus by Glory his ſeat is in Heaven, where his Servants dwell with him; by Grace and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction he is preſent in Holy places, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Aſſemblies, where his Servants walk with him, and worſhip him. Well then, conſider what thou art, and what God is into whoſe ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial preſence thou art come, and what is thy buſineſs with him Thou art a feeble infirm creature, made up of nothing but wants and weakneſſes; God is a Creator All-ſufficient to heal thy infirmities, to ſupply thy wants, and to manifeſt his ſtrength in thy weakneſs. It is thine own miſery and his mercy, which are the two chief motives that bring thee into his houſe of prayer. That which brought home the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal into his Fathers houſe, <hi>Luk. 15.17, 18.</hi> we may ſuppoſe brings thee into Gods houſe, want and woe in us untoward Children, pity and plenty in God a good and kind Father. For is not this our buſineſs with him, (if we do truly underſtand our own buſineſs) to have our needs and wants ſupplied, our ſins par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, our miſeries relieved by mercies, and a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> our inſufficiencies every way anſwered out o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb facs="tcp:51624:9"/>that inexhauſtible fountain of his goodneſs who is all-ſufficient? This is the beſt title we can give our ſelves, we are all but his creatures; and if we are just to our ſelves, and not partial, we must confeſs that we are none of the beſt creatures, by our own default, but vile and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious more than enough. Our dependance both for our being, and well being, and for what is requirable to both, is entirely upon our Creator, and him only, whoſe creatures we are; but whatever tends to our ruine, undoing, infelicity and miſery, is meerly from the Serpent and our ſelves. So that as I noted before, our own miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and Gods mercies, our wants, and Gods many ways to ſupply them, our ſins, our many ſins to be pardoned, and Gods inclinations, great inclinations for to pardon them, if we are truly and ſincerely penitent, are the two great motives, which bring us into Gods houſe, into his ſpecial preſence; but we are to lay open our ſelves before him, from whom we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hide our ſelves though we would; for he made us, and knows us, better than we know, or can know our ſelves. For there is not any creature that is not manifeſt in his ſight; there is no man ſhall be able to diſguiſe himſelf ſo cunningly, but God will diſcover him, all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him, with whom we have to do, <hi>Heb. 4.13.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:51624:10"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> But now in the third place, let us conſider what we are to do firſt, after we have made our adorations as we ought to do, when we are come into Gods houſe and ſpecial pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. Now methinks thoſe vile, unprofitable, and pernicious things called our ſins, (which are indeed properly our own) ſhould come to our remembrance. There is nothing ſo likely to hinder good things from us, as our ſins unconfeſſed, unrepented of: They hinder our prayers from aſcending acceptably unto God, for God will not hear ſinners, who bring no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but their ſins unrepented of for an offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and like <hi>Adonijah</hi> lay hold on the Altar with all their ſins and rebellions about them; and they hinder Gods bleſſings from deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding comfortably upon us. Therefore when we are come into the preſence of God, and are all met together in his houſe, to offer up our ſolemn Service and Sacrifice to him, we ought in the firſt place to make Confeſſion of our ſins, to which neceſſary and important duty we are not only moved and invited by the Word of God, in many places, and by many urgent motives and reaſons, but we are alſo by the ſame Word inſtructed how to perform it. We are not to diſſemble our ſins before that God, from whom we cannot hide them, but we are to confeſs and acknowledge our manifold ſins and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, with humble, lowly, penitent and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
<pb facs="tcp:51624:10"/>hearts, to the end that we may obtain forgiveneſs of the ſame by Gods infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and mercy. This is a duty which ought to be done by every private Christian at all times, in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>loſet, and in the ſecret hambers, but chiefly and moſt ſolemnly is to be done by all Chriſtians, when they are met together in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Aſſemblies; that having done this first, they may be the better diſpoſed to do other things, which are alſo then and there fit and neceſſary to be done. <hi>1.</hi> To render to God a tribute of thanks for mercies received. <hi>2.</hi> To render him a tribute of praiſe in the beſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions. <hi>3.</hi> To hear his Word with all atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, due reverence and devotion. <hi>4.</hi> To beg humbly of him all neceſſary things which we want, either for our ſouls or bodies, for our ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port or duty. All which things cannot be well done, nor done with any good ſucceſs by thoſe, who would endeavour to hide their ſins from God, and decline to make ſincere confeſſion of them, with a purpoſe to forſake them. For he that covereth his ſins, ſhall not proſper; but he that confeſſeth and forſaketh his ſins, ſhall have mercy, <hi>Prov. 28.13.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Thus far our conſiderations, as to our affairs in the Temple, and the houſe of God, are right, and being well entertained by us, and often and ſeriouſly thought upon, may
<pb facs="tcp:51624:11"/>rectifie many evils and diſorders, which by fools and inconſiderate perſons are too frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there committed. Now having ſeriouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered all that is before mentioned, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving reſolved to do it too upon ſerious conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, then it will in the next place concern us, when we are all preſent together, with pure hearts, and humble voices, to make our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to the Throne of Gods heavenly Grace, and to confeſs, (all meekly kneeling upon our knees) <hi>1.</hi> That God is Almighty, able to help us, and a moſt merciful Father, willing to hear us. <hi>2.</hi> That we are grievuous ſinners, who have neglected to do our duty, and have not refrained to do whatſoever is contrary to it. <hi>3.</hi> That our condition is ſad and deplorable, that there is nothing either in us, or from us, which can minister to us any relief; but that upon our unfeigned repentance, our departing from ſin, and amendment of our lives, and ſerious reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions to live better for the future, Grace is to be had from the Throne of Grace, by the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour of Grace Jeſus Christ. For as God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights not in the ſin of any man, but would have all men come to repentance; ſo neither is he pleaſed with the death of any penitent ſinner, but hath given forth his promiſes of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and forgiveneſs, to be authoritatively con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed by the mouths of his Miniſters, to all who have received the Grace of true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
<pb facs="tcp:51624:11"/>(which we are conſtantly to pray for) and are acted on by his holy Spirit to lead holy and pure lives; that ſo by living exactly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the meaſures of Grace received here, which is Glory begun, we may come to Glory hereafter, which is Grace complete, and all through Jeſus Chriſt, unto whoſe Throne we may come boldly, yet humbly, not trusting to our own merits, but relying upon Gods mercies through Christs merits, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help us in time of need, <hi>Heb. 4.16.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Having thus ſeriouſly compoſed our ſelves by a deep conſideration of our ſins both confeſſed and acknowledged, and by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of our wants to be ſupplied, and of the greatneſs and goodneſs of that God, to whom we are to make our addreſſes for the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of our ſins, and the ſupply of our wants; Then it is very well worthy our conſideration, and upon conſideration we may reſolve within our ſelves, that we cannot come with a better and more acceptable Prayer, to be offered up unto the Throne of Grace, than that which the Mediatour of Grace himſelf hath taught us, ſaying, <hi>When ye pray, ſay, Our Father which art in heaven,</hi> Luk. <hi>11.2.</hi> in which Prayer, before we offer it up, we may do well to take notice both of the method, and of the
<pb facs="tcp:51624:12"/>matter contained in it. The method of the Prayer is this; <hi>1.</hi> There is a Preface, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whom we pray to: We pray to God, who is a Father, and ſo willing; who is in Heaven, and ſo able to help us; who is ours in Chriſt, and ſo by a warrant and commiſſion given us from Christ, we may with the more confidence make our addreſſes to him As he is a Father, we pray to him in hope; as he is ours, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Father, we pray to him in hope; and as he is in Heaven, we pray to him in fear, humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and devotion. <hi>2.</hi> There are Petitions, ſhewing what we pray for, and in what order: Firſt, we pray to God (as it is fit we ſhould) for thoſe things which concern his Glory, and by which his Name may be hallowed and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified: Next, we pray for thoſe things, which concern our good of Glory, Grace, and Nature. We pray that Gods kingdom may come, that his power and dominion may appear all over the world; we pray that his will may be done by us men on earth, as it is done by the Holy Angels in heaven, and that we may all live in all holy obedience to his commands. We pray that God would give us daily bread, all things needful both for our ſouls and bodies, for our ſupport and duty whilſt we live here. In the next place we pray againſt the evil of ſin past, that God would in mercy pardon it, and incline us to have the like pity and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion
<pb facs="tcp:51624:12"/>one of another; we pray againſt the evil of ſin to come, that God would by his grace keep us from it; we pray alſo againſt the evil of puniſhment, external, internal, eternal, that God would keep it from us by his mercy. This is the ſumme of the Dominical or Lords Prayer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Being thus as it were refreſhed and enlivened by this Prayer, we are next to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in very good order to the more ſolemn Service and Worſhip of God deſiring his aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to open our lips, that we may praiſe him in the b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſt manner: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or without Gods grace we can do nothing; and it is most certain, that the Devil will be then moſt ready to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us, when we are moſt d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aving therefore peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned God in the Dominical Prayer, meekly kneeling upon our knees, and having joyntly craved his aſſiſtance in what is farther to be done, it follows next that we ſhould in the moſt chearful poſture, (which is ſtanding) exhibit to God our Lands and Praiſes, for all thoſe bleſſings which he hath most graciouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon us; which Praiſes of God cannot be better ſet forth, than in the Book of Pſalms, which his own Spirit hath endited; which once made up a great part of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Service, and which Chriſt himſelf conſecrated
<pb facs="tcp:51624:13"/>by his and the Apoſtles uſe of them, to bear a part in Chriſtian Aſſemblies. Wherein we are to conſider, <hi>1.</hi> Whom we are to praiſe, <hi>The Lord. 2.</hi> How we are to do it, joyntly with voices of Pſalmodiſts, and joyful hearts, <hi>Let us ſing, let us heartily rejoyce. 3.</hi> Why we are to do it, <hi>Becauſe he is the ſtrength of our Salvation,</hi> our mighty Saviour and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer, ready to ſupply all our needs, to help us in all our dangers and diſtreſſes, and can and will ſuccour us (if we relie upon him) when we are moſt deſtitute. O come therefore, <hi>let us ſing unto the Lord, let us heartily rejoyce in the ſtrength of our ſalvation, Pſal. 95.1.</hi> which Pſalm hath been uſed by the Church of God in all ages, for an Introit Pſalm, to put us in mind how we ſhould praiſe and glorifie God. Now as we invite our ſelves by this Pſalm to give glory to God, ſo it is meet and convenient that at the end of every Pſalm we ſhould actually do it, ſaying, Glory be to God the Father our Maker, to God the Son our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, to God the Holy Ghoſt our Sanctifier, as it hath been the ancient uſe in all Chriſtian Aſſemblies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Having offered up our Lands and Praiſes to God in a moſt ſolemn manner, whereby we may not only instruct our ſelves, but edifie Gods glory; then to give a kind of
<pb facs="tcp:51624:13"/>rest to our devotions, that they tire not, it follows in due and proper place, that we ſhould with all devout diligence, ſober, ſerious, and grave attention, give up our ſelves to the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Holy Scriptures diſtinctly and orderly read out of both the Teſtaments: For as it was once the practice of the Jews in their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Service, to have one Leſſon read out of the writings of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and another out of the other Prophets, that the people might ſee the Harmony and agreement betwixt <hi>Moſes</hi> and the reſt; ſo the like uſe and practice hath been obſerved by Chriſtians in their publick Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, to have one Leſſon read out of the Old Testament, and another out of the New, (only a Hymn uſed betwixt both, to take off from the tediouſneſs, and to make the Service the more recreative) that people may be able to ſee the Harmony of both the Teſtaments, to diſcern one God, one Chriſt, and one Spirit in both, and how the Old Teſtament carries the New along with it in the ſame bottom, that both aim at one and the ſame great deſign, to make men firſt holy, and then happy. And this reading of Scripture hath been in ancient times eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Preaching, as appears <hi>Act. 15.21.</hi> where it is ſaid, That <hi>Moſes</hi> of old time had in every City them that preached him, being read in the Synagogue every Sabbath-day. There are indeed other ways of preaching beſides this:
<pb facs="tcp:51624:14"/>Dilating upon a Text of Scripture, is prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching; Catechizing, is preaching; Expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, is preaching; yet this hinders not but bare reading of the Text may be preaching alſo, and may for ought I know edifie as well as any Gloſs made upon it. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or can we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that a ſet ſpeech of any man, made upon a Text of Scripture taken at all adventure, (though it may ſet an edge upon ſom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> hearers devotion) ſhould yet edifie more than the Text it ſelf, or adde any efficacy to that? Certainly the Sermons of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Prophets of Chriſt, and his Apoſtles, being often heard with attention and devotion, as they are often read, may inſtruct as much as any ſet ſpeech deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by men of meaner gifts, which may be as ſoon forgotten as it is ſpoken, and may be oft-times more obſcure too, than the Text which it endeavours to explain. This is not ſpoken to detract from ſolid and ſeaſonable preaching, but only to vindicate the Word read from that ſcorn, which too many put upon it in theſe evil days.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eighthly,</hi> Having devoutly heard the Word of God, and by often hearing of it, been well grounded and instructed in thoſe points of Faith, which are neceſſarily to be believed by all, who ſeek for ſalvation by Jeſus Chriſt the anointed Saviour, (which points of Faith are
<pb facs="tcp:51624:14"/>briefly ſummed up in the Apoſtles Creed, and only enlarged by way of explication in the <hi>Nicene</hi> and <hi>Athanaſian</hi>) it follows next in very good order, that we ſhould in a posture of reſolution, which is a ſtanding poſture, make publick and joynt Confeſſion of that Faith with our mouths, which we believe in our hearts; to ſhew that we dare own it in the face of all the world, and are not aſhamed of it. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we confeſs to believe, That there is one God maker of all things, one Chriſt redeemer of mankind, one Holy Spirit, ſanctifier of the elect people of God, which people are an holy ſociety or Church; Catholick, diſperſed over the world; and a Communion of Saints, firmly united by all the communications of love and charity, acted by the ſame Spirit, governed by the ſame Laws, leading holy and pure lives, having all the ſame hopes to have their ſins pardoned, their bodies raiſed from death to life again, and ſouls and bodies both re-united and crowned with glory in an immortal and end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs life. This is the ſumme of our Faith, which we are to make Confeſſion of after the hearing of the Word; Becauſe Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God, <hi>Rom. 10.17.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ninthly,</hi> Having thus far proceeded in the publick Service both for Morning and Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb facs="tcp:51624:15"/>in a right and due order, it is meet in the cloſe of all (when we have firſt prepared and fitted our ſelves by ſome quickning reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal Reſponds) that we ſumme up either in Litanies, univerſal Collects, or Collects apart, all that we are to pray unto God for, or to praiſe him for in publick Aſſemblies. Now all will come under the heads mentioned <hi>1 Tim. 2. verſ. 1, 2.</hi> which Text ſeems to be a platform, according to which the publick Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice fitted for Chriſtian Aſſemblies was firſt framed up; wherein we meet with, <hi>1. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications,</hi> for the averting of all hurtful things from us, ſins, and dangers, that God would turn us from the evil of ſin by Grace, and turn from us the evil of puniſhment by Mercy. <hi>2. Prayers,</hi> for the obtaining of all good things, which we want for our ſouls and bodies; for our ſouls, pardon of ſins past, and grace to forſake ſin for the future; for our bodies, all things needful and convenient for us whilſt we live here, what God knows beſt for us, in order to advance his glory, to promote the good of others, and the ſalvation of our own ſouls. <hi>3. Interceſſions,</hi> for others, for all mankind, for all Governours ſecular and ſpiritual, that they may act their parts over us, and we may live peaceably and quietly under them; For all perſons any ways afflicted, for enemies, perſecutors, and ſlanderers; and we are to beg
<pb facs="tcp:51624:15"/>of God for them the ſame good things as we would beg for our ſelves. <hi>4. Giving of thanks,</hi> wherein we are to bleſs God for all mercies already received, vouchſafed to our own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, to all who relate to us, to the Church and State whereof we are members, to all mankind. We are to give unto God the retribution of thanks, for all ſpiritual bleſſings, for giving us his Son and holy Spirit, for affording all means to bring ſinful men from their vitious courſes unto himſelf; for ſuffering us to be born within the pale of the Church, to be brought up in Christian Religion, where we have the advantages of the Word, Sacraments, and all the means of eternal life put into our hands. We are to render to God our thanks, for his patience and long-ſufferance, in waiting for our repentance; for his calls and invitations, outward by his Word, inward by his Spirit, to bring us to repentance; for his good, great, and gracious work wrought upon any of us, in bringing us clear off from prophane, worldly, and carnal courſes, to lead Godly and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian lives. We are alſo to praiſe God, and to give him the retribution of our thanks for temporal bleſſings, for the peace and proſperity of the Church and Nation, for all remarkable deliverances vouchſafed to either; for all the good things of this life in general, and in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular for health, food, raiment, friends, all
<pb facs="tcp:51624:16"/>preſervations and deliverances, and for all mercies whatſoever, which cannot eaſily be enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merated. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder all the forementioned heads, the main body of the Service constantly uſed in our Christian Aſſemblies, is contained; which Service is to be concluded with the Prieſts bleſſing and benediction, without which the Aſſemblies cannot well be diſmiſſed, or diſſolved.</p>
            <p>Theſe few conſiderations I thought good to recommend unto you, not ſo much to instruct the knowing, as to inform the ignorant, who either enter not Gods houſe at all, but it may be are worſe imployed when they ſhould be there, which is an evil they conſider not of, and ſo they offer God no Sacrifice at all; or elſe they enter it without any devotion or reverence, which is another evil that they conſider not of, and ſo they offer to God a Sacrifice of fools; or being entred, it may be do not understand their own offering which they are to offer up, and ſo they offer to God they know not what, ſerve him they know not how nor wherefore. But to correct thoſe evils, that perſons may come to the houſe of God, come as they ſhould come, and knowingly and underſtandingly do what there is fit to be done, I have preſented theſe conſiderations to thoſe, who do evil in Church-Aſſemblies, and conſider not when they
<pb facs="tcp:51624:16"/>do it. Theſe, Chriſtian Reader, with the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Notes made upon our Service-Book, I freely offer to thee, hoping that thou wilt as kindly accept them, as I do freely offer them, and I pray God to direct thee, and to give thee a right underſtanding in all things.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Note</hi> 1. THat Prayer is a devout aſcent of the Soul to God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we petition him for ſuch things as we need both for our ſupport and duty; and we ought to be frequent in this devout exerciſe, becauſe it is not only the great duty, but the greateſt priviledge of a Chriſtian, commanded by Chriſt's Precept, and commended by Chriſt's Example, who was frequent in Prayer not ſo much for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as for our benefit and inſtruction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note</hi> 2. That Prayers, eſpecially publick in the Church-Aſſemblies, are to be ordered, ſet and preſcribed; becauſe in the Church, which ought to be the School of comlineſs, things are to be done decently, by obſerving every due and proper Scheme and Figure,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:51624:18"/>which the action ſhall require, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the order and appointment of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Governours, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.40. It is much to be wondred at, that any perſons of ſober judgments, and well ground in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, can imploy their time ſo ill as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe and ſtudy objections againſt preſcribed Prayers in the publick Service of God: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſet forms were preſcribed by God in the Old Teſtament, <hi>Numb.</hi> 6.23, 24, 25. <hi>Deut.</hi> 26.5. Chriſt in the New not only en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned a ſet form to be uſed by his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.2. but he, whoſe every action ſhould be our inſtruction, uſed one himſelf. It was alſo the practice of the <hi>Jews,</hi> from the time of <hi>Ezra,</hi> and long before, conſtantly to uſe ſet forms of Prayer by way of Liturgy; neither did they uſe them only as a neceſſary proviſion for the Ignorant, but as a ſecure hedge and fence to their Religion, by this means to keep all mixtures and corruptions out of their Church; and they had 18 Prayers or Benedictions ſet and compoſed, according to the matter and form of which ſome ſay the Lords Prayer was inſtituted; and it is very probable, that in imitation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> the Pagans might uſe ſet forms at their Sacrifices, and moſt certainly they did; which forms were firſt approved of by the Prieſts, before they were uſed; and when
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51624:18"/>they did uſe them, they read them out of a Book, that they might neither ſtray in the matter of their Prayers, nor offend in the manner. And that the Church of Chriſt hath in all ages uſed a preſcribed and ſet Form, I think is not to be queſtion'd: After Chriſts aſcenſion, and before the Holy Ghoſts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion, they continued all with one accord in Prayer and Supplication, <hi>Act.</hi> 1.14. which Prayer was certainly in a ſet form, for as yet the Holy Ghoſt was not come down upon them, neither were they qualified for Prayer above the ordinary rate of other men; and when the Holy Ghoſt did come down with his extraordinary gifts, thoſe gifts continued not long, and therefore an early proviſion was made for ſet forms to be conſtantly uſed, to ſupply the defects of them; which Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies (as ours is) were framed up according to St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s preſcribed pattern, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1. conſiſting, 1. <hi>Of Supplications,</hi> for the avert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all hurtful things, ſins and dangers. 2. <hi>Of Prayers,</hi> for the obtaining of all good things, which they wanted or ſtood in need of. 3. <hi>Of Interceſſions,</hi> for others, for Kings and all in Authority, for the whole Church. 4. <hi>Of Thanksgivings,</hi> for mercies already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived: in all which they prayed not only for themſelves, but in a greater diffuſion of their charity for all mankind. And all were
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51624:19"/>preſcribed, 1. That the people might the better joyn with the Miniſter, and ſay <hi>Amen</hi> to the Prayer. 2. That the peoples wants might be the better enumerated, the people themſelves be the better edified, all abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in Prayer might be avoided, and all might with one mind and one mouth glorifie God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.6.</p>

            <head>EXPLANATION.</head>
            <p>This Confeſſion, as appears by the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited Texts, is exactly agreeable to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and is rationally and upon prudent grounds allowed the firſt place in our pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Liturgy. We begin our Service with Confeſſion of ſin for theſe reaſons, 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our ſins make a ſeparation betwixt God and us, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.2. keep good things from us, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.25. hinder our prayers from aſcending acceptably to God, and God's bleſſings from deſcending comfortably upon us. 2. It was the practice of God's people the <hi>Jews,</hi> to begin their Service with a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Confeſſion of ſin, of which we have the marks and ſigns in the Law, <hi>Lev.</hi> 16.16. and the pattern and platform in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; but the Confeſſions themſelves are particularly to be met with in the Books of the <hi>Jews.</hi> This verbal Confeſſion (of which we have an inſtance <hi>Luke</hi> 1.10.) made the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:51624:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Jews</hi> fully acquainted with the true uſe of Sacrifices: Beſides, Almighty God being jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of his honour, commanded a brazen Laver to be ſet between the Tabernacle of the Congregation and the Altar, for <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons twice in a day to waſh their hands and feet, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30.17, 18, 19, 20, 21. by which was ſignified the Laver of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, which we always ſtand in need of: From the <hi>Jews</hi> it afterwards became a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom in the Chriſtian Church, to begin their publick Service with Confeſſion of ſin, and to perform it in ſuch a manner as we do. The very Heathens had ſomething amongſt them which ſeemed to allude to it, for they uſed to wipe off the dirt from their feet when they entred into the places of their Religious Service and Sacrifice. However, it is moſt certainly agreeable to right Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Religion, that we ſhould begin our Service to God with Confeſſion of our ſins; that having firſt confeſſed our ſins, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored God's pardon for them, we may the better pray unto him, and praiſe him for other things. So <hi>David</hi> began with, <hi>Waſh me throughly from mine iniquity, and cleanſe me from my ſin,</hi> Pſal. 51.2. and then he ſays, <hi>Open thou my lips, O Lord, and my mouth ſhall ſhew forth thy praiſe,</hi> ver. 15. becauſe ſin doth ſhut up our mouth, and God par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:51624:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſin, opens it that we may chearfully pray unto him and praiſe him. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Confeſſion of ſin is enjoyned to be ſaid of the whole Congregation after the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, it is for theſe reaſons; 1. Becauſe the Miniſter is the peoples mouth to God-ward in Prayer, both to go before them and to inſtruct them, as in Preaching he is Gods mouth to the people. 2. By this means the Church, like a careful Mother, makes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion ſo far as ſhe can, that none of her untoward children ſhould diſſemble their wickedneſs, the humble and penitent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion whereof is made ſo neceſſary an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction to her Divine Offices. Now this Confeſſion is to be made kneeling, becauſe it is the fitteſt poſture for Penitents, that by the outward lowlineſs of our bodies, we may the better expreſs the inward humility of our minds. All Holy men we meet with in Scripture, were for this poſture of kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at their devotion; <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 95.6. <hi>Solomon,</hi> 2 Chron. 6.13. <hi>Ezra,</hi> chap. 9.5. <hi>Daniel,</hi> chap. 6.10. <hi>Christ,</hi> Luk. 22.41. <hi>Stephen,</hi> Acts 7.60. <hi>Paul,</hi> Acts 20.36. God would not have us when we come before him to worſhip him, to offer to him, and to receive from him, to be as if we had no joynts in our knees; he expects more from us then from the Pillars of our Churches:
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:51624:23"/>Every day we begin our Service with a Pſalm which invites us to it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95.6. And the firſt Chriſtians ever uſed to begin their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in this manner, ſaying, <hi>Before all things let us fall down and worſhip the Lord who made us.</hi> This was the firſt voice heard, and the firſt thing done in the Primitive Church. We daily utter the ſame voice, and daily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite our ſelves to do the ſame thing, and ſhall we never do it for all this? what is this but to mock God? nay to mock and abuſe our ſelves, for God will not be mocked; he knows our miſdemeanours in his Service, and how to apportion out puniſhments in his own due time, ſuch as we deſerve. As <hi>Auguſtus</hi> the Emperour ſaid to one, who came rudely into his preſence to petition, <hi>I wonder how we two come to be ſo familiar;</hi> ſo if we do but obſerve how rudely, and with what unmannerly behaviour ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons come into Gods preſence, to beg par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of him for their ſins, it may raiſe more wonder to think how God and they come to be ſo familiar.</p>

            <head>EXPLANATION.</head>
            <p>The Abſolution is as to every part of it grounded upon Scripture; Remiſſion and Abſolution are two names, which ſignifie one and the ſame thing, a looſing from ſin, wherein the Soul is held bound as in a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 142.7. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.32. Sin is as a yoke, burden, chain, fetter, which loads, binds, and holds faſt the Soul, <hi>Lam.</hi> 1.14. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38.4. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.6. Abſolution helps to remove this yoke, to lighten this burden, to looſe this chain. Sin is a debt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.12. <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.4. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.27. by Abſolution and Remiſſion we are acquitted and diſcharged from this debt. The Heathens looked upon the characteriſtick <hi>(A)</hi> when ſet alone, as a propitious letter, becauſe it noted amongſt the <hi>Romans</hi> the Abſolution of a Criminal; whereas the characteriſtical letter <hi>(C)</hi> was the mark of a condemned perſon: but in Chriſtianity, let <hi>(C)</hi> for Confeſſion be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced before <hi>(A)</hi> for Abſolution, it alters the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:51624:24"/>caſe very much. Some perſons indeed have been very much offended at the word <hi>(Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution,)</hi> and therefore prevailed to have the word <hi>(Remiſſion)</hi> ſtand by it, to be its Interpreter into milder ſenſe; thoſe perſons I conceive to be like ſome people, which I have read of, who fearing their Tygers, called them by more gentle names, that they might not be devoured by them. But ſome ſcruple may again be made, why the Prieſt alone ſhould pronounce this Abſolution, and that in the ſtanding poſture, when all the people are ſtill upon their knees? Which ſcruple may eaſily be removed from thoſe, who can diſtinguiſh the Prieſt and a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter in his Office, from an ordinary perſon not inveſted into Holy Orders: For the Prieſt, eſpecially when in his Office, and officiating, is in Chriſt's ſtead, and acting in one part of his Commiſſion given to him by Chriſt, which is to abſolve penitents, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.19. <hi>John</hi> 20.23. Neither doth he abſolve by way of declaration only, but by way of authority, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.14, 15. which au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is abſolutely and originally in God, who is only able to forgive ſins by the higheſt and moſt unqueſtionable authority, <hi>Mark</hi> 2.8. Yet there is by the Charter of the Church a ſubordinate delegate power, derived from God by Chriſt to the Prieſts
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:51624:25"/>and Miniſters, for to remit or to retain ſin, <hi>John</hi> 20.22, 23. The Prieſt remits or retains ſin, as a Civil Magiſtrate pardons or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns a Malefactor, not by any power ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally in themſelves, but by a power de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legated from God. And to ſhew by what power he acts, the Prieſt pronounceth the Abſolution ſtanding; and when the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of ſin is ſerious, from the heart, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned, ſuch as God requires and will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of, the Prieſt's Abſolution is without queſtion as effectual, as if God himſelf did pronounce it from Heaven. Heaven waits for, and expects the Prieſt's ſentence on Earth; and if the perſon to be abſolved, by an hypocritical and feigned repentance, make not the key to fail in ſuch caſes, what the Servant binds or looſes here on Earth, the Lord himſelf ratifies and confirms in Heaven, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.18, 19. Now in the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to be pronounced by the Miniſter, or rather after it, this clauſe is added, <hi>Wherefore let us beſeech him to grant us true repentance, and his holy Spirit,</hi> and may ſeem to be added for theſe reaſons following; 1. To ſhew that as Repentance is a neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry diſpoſition to pardon, ſo that it is alſo a neceſſary conſequent of it; for he who is pardoned, ought to be as much a penitent (if he truly underſtands himſelf) as he who
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:51624:25"/>ſeeks pardon; as we are daily liable to ſin, ſo for our own ſafety we are to ſecure and keep our ſelves within the ſtate of pardon, which we cannot do but by continuing in a ſtate of Repentance; beſides, the ſad re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of ſin (though pardon'd) ought to be always grievous to us. 2. Becauſe after a ſin is pardoned and remitted, the Devil is moſt buſie to tempt the ſinner either to commit the ſame ſin again, or a worſe; therefore as in the Lords Prayer we are taught to pray, firſt to have our ſins for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given, and next not to be led into tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſo here no ſooner is Abſolution and Remiſſion of ſins declared and pronounced by the Prieſt, as a great priviledge and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour granted to all ſincere Penitents, and ſound believers, but the ſame pardoned per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are invited and ſtirred up in their own defence, to pray for a continued Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and aſſiſtance of Gods holy Spirit, that they may be ſecure from all Satans tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for the future, and make the grace of Pardon already granted, a new obligation to more holy living; that ſo we may not only pleaſe God in our preſent Devotions, but alſo in our future life; for moſt certain it is, that every lapſe after pardon is the greater ſin, <hi>John</hi> 5.14. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.20. But we are to note in the laſt place, that the people
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:51624:26"/>are enjoyned to anſwer <hi>Amen,</hi> as at the end of this, ſo of every Prayer in the Service-Book, becauſe <hi>Amen</hi> if pronounced as from the heart, is an Indication of the peoples aſſent to the preceding Prayer, and an affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation that the thing prayed for is good and neceſſary for them, and a tollification of the peoples votes and deſires to obtain it. It hath ever been uſed at the end of Prayers, and pronounced with a loud voice, carrying in it devotion, zeal and fervency; it is the laſt acclamation of our prayers, in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing of which the Primitive Chriſtians were wont to raiſe up their bodies, as if they had a deſire to carry their bodies as well as their ſouls up to Heaven.</p>

            <p>They muſt certainly be vain and wicked, acted on by ſome wild and extravagant ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, who to make way for their own crude and humane breathings, (not fit ſometimes to carry the name of Prayers) would thruſt the Lords Prayer quite out, and allow it no place in the publick Divine Service, which is as the Salt of the Sacrifice, and that which ſhould ſeaſon all our Liturgick Offices. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly as men may uſe other Prayers, ſo they ought not to be reſtrained, nor to reſtrain themſelves from the uſe of this, which is a Prayer uſed by the Church of Chriſt all the world over, dictated at firſt by the ſupreme wiſdom of our great and eternal Mediator Jeſus Chriſt, who preſents our Prayers unto God, and perfectly knows our Fathers mind: It is the moſt complete Prayer which can be made, ſumming up all the moſt lawful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts which can be imagined, the epitome, mirrour, rule of all other Prayers, in a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:51624:27"/>brevity of words, including ſo great plenty and variety of matter, as if it would make a Camel to paſs through a Needles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eye: It contains in it more hiſtories and myſteries, then words; it is the moſt metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical, emphatical, divine Prayer, that ever yet was or ſhall be compoſed, for all the parts of it cohere with an admirable ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry; it is exactly made in meaſure and proportion, all of it is full of Torches, which enlighten each other; not all the wits on Earth, nor Angels in Heaven, were ever ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of dictating the like. There is as much difference betwixt this, and Prayers of man's compoſing, as betwixt the Tabernacle and Pattern upon the Mount: the Tabernacle was Earthly, framed by man; the Pattern Heavenly, formed by God: ſo this Prayer is all over coeleſtial and divine, whereas our Prayers are at the beſt but humane, and framed up by man's induſtry: Neither is there any man ſo knowing or ſo religious, who is not ſubject to many failings in the compoſure of his Prayers; they are ſubject to imperfection, to exceſs, to diſorders, to many irregularities; we cannot poſſibly be without ſome errour in this buſineſs, either we want or exceed, are too ſhort or too long, or raiſe our thoughts out of rank and place, when we ſpeak our own Prayers; but
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:51624:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>in ſaying the Lords Prayer (if our hearts go along with the prayer) we cannot fail to ſpeak well; we omit nothing, we ſpeak no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſuperfluous, we are not extravagant, we cannot be impertinent in our words: Therefore having framed up Prayers accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to what is poſſible for us to do, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving well conſidered the defects of them, we have recourſe to this moſt abſolute Prayer of Chriſt, for the perfecting of all the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections in our own. Certainly we, who are Chriſtians, ought to ſay this Prayer, becauſe Jeſus Chriſt hath put it into our mouths, and made it to be the abridgment of all Prayer, wherein are ſummed up all lawful requeſts. He hath given it to be a rule and guide for us to pray by, and an exact form for us to pray in: It is a Prayer of univerſal concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in reſpect of things contained in it, perſons uſing it, times when, and places where it may be uſed. All the Churches of the Chriſtian World pronounce it, and it muſt needs be a great conſolation to us to keep our part in this great conſort; we may ſay it in proſperity and adverſity, in Peace and War, in health and ſickneſs, in life and at the hour of death; young and old, rich and poor, noble and ignoble, Princes and Peaſants may all pronounce it together. Therefore not without good reaſon is it ſo
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:51624:28"/>frequently uſed in our Liturgick Offices, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is ſo large for matter, ſo ſhort and compendious for phraſe and words, ſo ſweet for order, in all reſpects ſo perfect and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, we give it the moſt place in our pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick devotions; ſometimes begin with it to guide our prayers, and ſometimes conclude with it to compleat and perfect them. Wherever Chriſtian Religion is profeſſed, this prayer is uſed as one of the principal and moſt material duties of honour done to Jeſus Chriſt. The often repeating of it, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bring it within the compaſs of that vain repetition, which our Saviour condemned, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.7. for repetition is then only vain, when words are often repeated being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected neither with reaſon of Art, nor with zeal and devotion of heart, nor with any ſuppoſal of a juſtly implyed neceſſity, all which moſt certainly may meet in the uſe of this prayer, how frequently ſoever we make uſe of it. For becauſe we cannot pray as we ought, there is a kind of neceſſity for us to uſe it to ſupply our defects, and that with art and zeal (we hope) ſufficient. Again, ſeeing we have an Advocate with the Father interceding continually for ſinners, when we ſeek for pardon of our ſins at Gods hand, we cannot do better then alledge unto God the words which our Advocate hath taught
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:51624:28"/>us; ſeeing he hath promiſed that ſhall be granted which we ask in his name, we may be confident that will not be denied which we ask in his name and words. When in our prayers we ſpeak unto the Father in the Sons own preſcribed form of words, we may be ſure that we utter nothing which God will either diſallow, or deny. The Miniſter is to begin this prayer with an audible voice, and the people all kneeling are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat it orderly after him, for theſe ſuppoſed reaſons; 1. That people ignorantly educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted may learn it, and be inſtructed in it. 2. To ſhew what an eſteem we ought to have for it, and for Chriſt our Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, who was the Author of it; and for Chriſtianity it ſelf, and the Chriſtian Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, wherein all of us are to bear a part. But that people may ſay this prayer under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandingly, I ſhall add this plain Paraphraſe upon it.</p>

            <p>The forementioned Verſicles with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponſes, are Canonical Scripture, and taken moſt-what out of the Book of Pſalms; by which we acknowledge our dependance upon God, and that we are unable of our ſelves to perform any Religious duty well, unleſs God enable us. They are uſed inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changably by Miniſter and People, to teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie mutual Love, to ſtrengthen affection, to ſtir up devotion, to kindle and enflame it one in another, to oblige us to greater at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention; and this praying by way of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponſe, is grounded upon the Scripture, and conformable to the practice of the earlieſt
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:51624:31"/>and pureſt times of Chriſtianity. And for the form of giving glory to God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, it is very ancient, by which we avouch our Doctrine and Faith of the Trinity againſt all oppoſers; as we have received from Chriſt and his Apoſtles, ſo we baptize, believe, and give glory to God Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt; and this we do not without Scripture-warrant, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.36. It is the Chriſtians Hymn and ſhorter Creed; ſome who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed Chriſtianity, had corrupted this form of giving glory to God, and had framed up another form, in favour of their own new opinions and perſwaſions in Religion, differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from that of the Ancient Chriſtians both in words and ſenſe; but the ancient form, which was before, and is ſtill uſed, was again reſtored, upon the reſtauration of which thoſe words were added, <hi>As it was in the beginning, &amp;c.</hi> that is, in the firſt beginning of the true Religion profeſſed and ſolemnly owned by the name of Chriſtian. Now cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly very meet it is that we ſhould give glory to God, becauſe it is appropriate to God alone, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 115.1. It is his peculiar right, which he lays claim to, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.8. for he is the King of Glory. The Heavens de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.1. the Angels chant it, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.14. Seraphims reſound it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.3.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:51624:32"/>and man is no leſs obliged to it, then thoſe coeleſtial Spirits are. No place on earth is more proper for it, then God's houſe, where every man ſhould ſpeak of his honour; and there is no better poſture to do it in, then ſtanding, for by it we ſhew our chearful rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs to give glory to God, and our pious reſolution to ſtand faſt in the Faith of the Holy Trinity. And for thoſe words, <hi>Praiſe ye the Lord,</hi> they are the ſame with Hallelu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah; ſet at the end of the five laſt Pſalms in the Pſalter, and uſed in this place, to be as an impreſſion invitatory to the following Pſalms: and the following Reſponſe, <hi>The Lords name be praiſed,</hi> is according to what we find written <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.48.</p>

            <head>EXPLANATION.</head>
            <p>The Pſalter was anciently divided into ſeveral portions called Nocturns, by which diviſion the Pſalms were read every week, and this was a cuſtom peculiar only to the <hi>Latine</hi> Church; for in the <hi>Syrian</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Churches, the Pſalter was read over every twenty days: Our Church allows a months ſpace for the reading over the Book of Pſalms; and her meaning is, that they ſhould be read in publick, according to ancient practice, by way of Reſponſe. Now the reaſons why the Pſalms are ſo frequently read over, and why in this manner, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to be theſe. Becauſe the Pſalms do contain in them the choice and flower of all things profitable, which may be met withall in the Holy Scriptures; and do more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly expreſs them, by reaſon of the Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical form wherein they are written. No part of Scripture doth more admirably ſet forth all the conſiderations and operations, which belong to God, nor ſo magnifie the Holy meditations and actions of Divine men; They are an univerſal declaration of things Heavenly, working in thoſe, whoſe hearts God inſpireth with a due conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and diſpoſition of mind, whereby they
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:51624:34"/>are made fit veſſels both for receipt and delivery of whatſoever Spiritual perfection. There is nothing neceſſary for man to know, which the Pſalms are not able to teach: They are to beginners, a familiar introduction; to thoſe who are entred into the way of Religion, a mighty augmenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of vertue and knowledge; and to the moſt perfect, a ſtrong confirmation. Heroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal magnanimity, exquiſite Juſtice, grave moderation, exact wiſdom, Repentance un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned, unwearied Patience, the myſteries of God, the ſufferings of Chriſt, the terrours of Wrath, the comforts of Grace, the works of Providence over the world preſent, and the promiſed Joys of the next; all good ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be known, done, or had, are laid up in this Store-houſe; no grief incident to man's ſoul, or ſickneſs to the body, but a remedy may be found for it in the Book of Pſalms. As the Holy Scripture exceeds other writings in verity, ſo the Book of Pſalms exceeds other Sacred Scriptures in variety. The Pſalter is the common trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury of all good arguments and inſtructions; the ſummary, pith and breviary of the whole Bible: therefore as the Church eſteemed nothing more generally neceſſary for the Worſhip of God, then the Word of God; ſo ſhe judged no parcel of the Word more
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:51624:34"/>full and fit, then the Pſalms. But it is to be wiſhed, that we could all endeavour to make our lives conformable to thoſe Holy patterns, who were the Pen-men of theſe Pſalms; and that the Pſalmiſts infuſions and effuſions, may find in us the Pſalmiſts ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual affections to go along with them; that when we ſay or ſing over theſe Pſalms, we may not ſpeak againſt our ſenſe, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or conſcience, nor blame the Pſalm, or Church for enjoyning it to be uſed, when we our ſelves perhaps are in fault. He who would make a right and good uſe of the Pſalms, read over in private or publick, muſt endeavour to form his Spirit to the affection of the Pſalm: if it be the affection of love, which runs through the Pſalm, it is to be read with the ſame affection; if of fear, the ſame Spirit of fear ſhould be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed upon the Soul; if of deſire, it ſhould be carried on with the like tranſportation; if of gratitude to God, the Soul ſhould be lifted up with praiſes, and come with affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions that way enflamed: If the Pſalm car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in it the Spirit of Prayer and Supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of Praiſe or Euchariſt, he who dares to read it, muſt ſtill conform, and bring down his Spirit to the Pſalm; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever affection is in any Pſalm, the heart is to comply with that affection; that by this
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:51624:35"/>means the often repeating of the Pſalms, may not prove a ridiculous piece of Pagean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, we ſhould ſtrive to ſay the Pſalms with the ſame Spirit, with which they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired who compoſed them; and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate our ſelves to them in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as if we our ſelves had been the compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers, or as if they had been purpoſely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed for our uſe, by exciting up in our ſelves the ſame affections, which we may diſcern to have been in <hi>David</hi> or others, at the ſame time when they compoſed them. We are to love when they love, fear when they fear, hope when they hope, praiſe God when they praiſe him, weep for our own ſins and others when they weep, beg what we want with the like Spirit wherewith their petitions are framed; love our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies when they love theirs, pray for ours when they pray for theirs, have zeal for Gods glory when they profeſs it, humble our ſelves when they are humbled, and lift up our Spirits to Heaven when they lift up theirs; give thanks for Gods mercies when they do; delight and rejoyce in the benefits of the Meſſias, and beauties of the Church, when they do; relate the wonderful works of God in the creation of the World, and deliverance of his people, with the like ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration and praiſe as they do; and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:51624:35"/>there is mention of puniſhments in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted on rebellious ſinners, and rewards and favours beſtowed upon the obedient, we are to tremble where they tremble, and to rejoyce where they rejoyce; we are to walk in Gods Sanctuary as they walked, and to wiſh to dwell in it as they wiſhed. And wherever the Pſalmiſt as a Maſter tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, exhorteth, reprehendeth, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recteth, we are to ſuppoſe him ſpeaking to every one of us, and we ſhould anſwer him in ſuch due manner as he requires. And at the beginning of every Pſalm, we ſhould beg of God that affection which the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt had when he compoſed it, and deſire to attain the ſame guift and ſpiritual ſavour which he felt. Was this courſe as conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſed, as the reading over the Book of Pſalms, we ſhould in time be of the Pſalmiſts temper and devotion; and the uſage of the Pſalms would not ſeem ſo ſtrange, as perhaps they may to ſome, for want of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving this good rule preſcribed by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients. It is a courſe which the devouter Chriſtians ever obſerved, and they found it hugely advantageous for the heightning and enflaming of their devotions. Some ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples may be made by ſome perſons, againſt the reading of Scripture in general, and againſt the Pſalms in particular, the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votional
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:51624:36"/>part of Scripture; for they were moſt of them compoſed by <hi>David,</hi> the Type of Chriſt, and the beſt fitted and qualified of any man to ſet down a formulary of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions, in which are contained the moſt remarkable things, which concern Chriſt or Chriſtianity; and which may well enough be uſed by all, who are ſincerely Chriſtian, either as forms of Prayers or Praiſes, of which they conſiſt for the moſt part. Indeed ſome Pſalms ſeem to have no propriety of the Spirit of Chriſtianity, being ſpent in calling down vengeance upon Gods and the Pſalmiſts enemies, which is contrary to the Goſpel-temper, <hi>Luk.</hi> 9.54, 55. but herein lies our great miſtake, for <hi>David</hi> the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> by whom the Spirit of the Lord ſpake, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.2. could not have in him the leaſt malignity or revenge in the penning of his Pſalms, not of thoſe of the ſevereſt character; for in thoſe Pſalms he did not ſo properly pray as a petitioner, that God would bring ſuch and ſuch Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon obſtinate ſinners, as he did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict and denounce as a Prophet, the juſt Judgments of God, which would inevitably fall upon ſuch ſinners. Such Pſalms are Propheſies and Predictions, not properly Prayers, and they may eaſily be accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated to the Chriſtian affection, Spirit and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:51624:36"/>temper. All Texts of Scripture in either Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, of this ſeemingly-ſevere temper and nature, may be ſafely admitted into the very bowels of our Souls, if they could be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted alſo to perform the work, which they are deſigned for; that is, to melt us into contrition, to mortifie us, to reform us, to bruiſe our Souls, to purge all droſs out of them, to refine and prepare them for holy duties. Beſides, the <hi>Jews,</hi> under whoſe Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie the Pſalms were penned and compoſed, were a Typical people, and Gods Oeconomie to them may be inſtructive to us, not in a literal, but ſpiritual ſenſe; what ſeverity was required from them towards the <hi>Canaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites,</hi> and other enemies of God, the ſame ſhould be tranſcribed by us in another way; that is, we ſhould expreſs our diſpleaſure and revenge upon our luſts and ſins, as the greateſt enemies of God, or us; and thus our indignation and zeal, our imprecations and Anathema's, may be ſeaſonable enough, if we continue them only in this ſenſe; but for the curſing of any other enemies, it is hardly reconcilable to Chriſtianity; neither can it be warranted out of the Pſalms, or any other part of Scripture, to be uſed as a Prayer, but only as a prediction or denun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation; and this may be done upon a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign purely Chriſtian and charitive enough.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:51624:37"/>And whereas many things in the Pſalms, may ſeem not to ſuit well with every mans condition at all times, and ſo the Spirit of the Reciter may meet with a kind of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, forbidding to go along with the Spirit of the Pſalmiſt; (as for inſtance, how can a man overwhelmed with diſtreſs, h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ve the lively vigorous Spirit of Praiſe or Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt? or a man in a proſperous ſtate, have the true Spirit of devotion and humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?) yet this ſcruple may be eaſily remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, thus; That though the Pſalms read may not ſuit ſo properly with our own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, yet they may ſuit with the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of others, to the beſt advantages; and in our publick Services, we are to put upon us publick Spirits, and mind the ſtate and condition of other men, as well as of our ſelves: we are to rejoyce with them that do rejoyce, and to weep with them that weep, and to be of the ſame mind one towards another, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.15, 16. we are to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thoſe who are in bonds, as bound with them, and thoſe who ſuffer adverſity, being our ſelves alſo in the body, <hi>Febr.</hi> 13.3. Therefore do we pray for the ſick, when we our ſelves are in health; give thanks for the deliverance of others, when we our ſelves are not in their dangers. This we do as Chriſtians, not as meer men, nor as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:51624:37"/>urgeth us to it, but as charity binds us; whereby we ſhew, that as Chriſt is the Head of the body, ſo we are Members one of another. This is truly Chriſtian, when we can zealouſly comprehend others within our Prayers or Praiſes, either for what they ſtand in need of, or have received. And it will be a very hard matter for any one of us, to mention any one of the Pſalms, which we may not have ſome propriety to, in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever condition we are. In our greateſt proſperity, we may have cauſe enough to humble our ſelves; in our greateſt diſtreſs, there may be good grounds for giving of thanks. <hi>Job</hi> was ſummoned to bleſs God as well for his ſufferings, as for his enjoyments, <hi>Job</hi> 1.21. and many holy and pious men, have ſeen ground and cauſe enough for their humiliation, in the midſt of their greateſt affluence and abundance. And whereas ſome of the Pſalms are advanced to that high pitch of devotion, which ordinary men, who are not of the Pſalmiſts ſpirit and temper, cannot poſſibly reach to; yet theſe very Pſalms ſhould be made familiar, and be of conſtant uſe, if for no other reaſon, yet for this, to quicken our dull devotions, to give ſome ſpirit and life to our dead, and not enough vigorous performances in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God, and to make us ſee how much
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:51624:38"/>we fall ſhort of thoſe holy and divine Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Pſalms, who as to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Faith, zeal, love, and obedience to God, ought to be looked upon as worthy patterns for our imitation; and by reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of us for our own defects, may hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble us before God, becauſe we cannot ſo vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly pronounce theſe holy Hymns as we ought to do, and may teach us to pray for more growth and ſpiritual proficiency, in our conſtant Religious performances.</p>

            <head>EXPLANATION.</head>
            <p>The reading of Leſſons out of the Old and New Teſtament, is in punctual imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Ancient Church; which Leſſons are not left arbitrary, but appointed, ſome for ordinary days, and ſome for Feſtival, according to Primitive cuſtom and practice. As the <hi>Jews</hi> uſed to read ſome Leſſons, and portions of Scripture, out of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the other Prophets, upon their Sabbaths and Feſtivals, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.27. which they called Sections, or Tractats of a good day, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2.16. ſo it was decreed and ordered in the Church Chriſtian, and in imitation ſo near as could be of what was practiſed in the Jewiſh Church, that the firſt Leſſon ſhould be read out of the Old Teſtament, and the ſecond out of the New. And it was ſo contrived, that Hymns, Leſſons and Pſalms ſhould be uſed interchangably, to take off ſomething from the tediouſneſs of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; for as variety is pleaſant to the body, ſo is it alſo to the Soul: therefore is the Service made ſo Moſaick, and of ſo many pieces commodiouſly diſpoſed, to reſcue each other from faſtidiouſneſs. Neither do we read only the Canonical Scripture, but ſome part alſo of the Apocryphal Books,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:51624:39"/>which appear to be moſt agreable to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical; in the doing of which, we do not conſider both under the ſame parity of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and eſtimation, for our Bibles have ſufficiently made a diſtinction. And though it cannot be denied, that the Ancient mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del of Canonical and Apocryphal Books, did paſs under a complex notion of the Old Teſtament; yet we read not the Apocry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phal Books, as we do Canonical Scripture, to ground any Article of Faith upon; only we read them for inſtruction in life and manners, and upon the ſame account as the Epiſtle of <hi>Clement</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> was wont to be read in Churches in Ancient times. Neither are any Chapters or Leſſons ſo preſcribed out of the Apocryphal Books, as that we ſhould ſet aſide the Canonical Scripture, for the Miniſter is left to his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, to make his choice as he thinks fit, either of the one, or of the other. We read the Apocryphal Books, becauſe they are conſonant to the Canonical, becauſe they were reſpected by the Ancients, becauſe they are inſtructive in their ſtile, and ſome paſſages in them do explain the Canonical Scripture, which they, who moſt oppoſe them, cannot honeſtly deny; and why may they not be as well read and approved of, as our own Comments upon a Text of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:51624:39"/>which (it is to be preſumed) we would not have to be taken for Canonical Scripture. They who are moſt againſt the reading of them, cannot but confeſs our Sermons and Tractates to have as little of the Spirit of infallibility and Sanctification, as the Apocryphal Books. So far as they are conſonant to the Word of God, they are Canonical, though not Proto-Canonical. There is truth in them, and we are to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace truth wherever we meet with it; for it is Gods, whoever ſpeaks it or writes it: we read them not to confirm us in matters of Faith, but to inſtruct us in life and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, becauſe they contain in them many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent moral precepts, for the regulating of our lives, and well ordering of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations. Again, ſome part of the Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical is not enjoyned to be read publickly in the Congregation, not becauſe the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of it is undervalued, but becauſe it is not ſo uſeful for Edification, nor ſo fitted to the underſtandings and capacities of the people, as thoſe portions of Scripture are, which are enjoyned to be read; thoſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary parts of Scripture which God hath made eaſie, the Church deſires ſhould be made familiar, and frequently read to the people. Therefore ſhe orders the Pſalms to be read over once every month, moſt part
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:51624:40"/>of the Old Teſtament once a year, the New thrice; and hath ſo ſorted the Leſſons, Prayers, Pſalms, Epiſtles and Goſpels, for ſome Feſtivals, that they edifie as much as any ordinary Sermons, if people were but ſo wiſe, as to conſider the wiſe directions of the Church, and to value her prudence, as much as they do their own fooliſh humors. Now the Leſſons are taken one out of the Old, another out of the New Teſtament, that by frequent reading of them, we may obſerve the Harmony of both: for as the Cherubins of Glory looked each upon other, and both cloſed with their wings over the Mercy-ſeat; ſo the Two Teſtaments look each upon other, both upon Chriſt, who is the ſupplement of the one, and the comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the other; in the one promiſed, in the other exhibited; the Law being an hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Goſpel, and the Goſpel a revealed Law. The Patriarchs, Prophets, Evangeliſts, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, wrote by the ſame Spirit, pointed at the ſame Meſſias, were ſaved by the ſame Faith; and this may very much confirm us in the truth of the Scriptures, when we read that exactly fulfilled in the New Teſtament, which was ſo punctually foretold in the Old. Beſides, it may be a means of converting the Jews, as well as confirming us Chriſtians; for they may in time embrace Chriſt's Goſpel
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:51624:40"/>with us, when they ſee us embrace <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets together with them. But in taking Leſſons firſt out of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and then out of the New, the Church obſerves the method of the Holy Spirit, who firſt publiſhed the Old, then the New; firſt the precepts of the Law, then of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; and by this method we are taught to go forward in our knowledge, from ſmaller things to greater, from the loweſt to the higheſt; for the Law is as a Paedagogue teaching the firſt Rudiments, the Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of higheſt perfection are contained in the Goſpel. The Miniſter is to read the Leſſons diſtinctly, with a ſober, grave, and audible voice; and he is to turn himſelf towards the people, when he reads, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is upon an office directed to them; whereas in Prayer, he looks another way, towards the more eminent part of the Church, where uſe to be placed the Symbols of God's more eſpecial preſence, with whom the Miniſter in Prayer hath chiefly to do. For the ſame reaſon we may ſuppoſe, that the Chriſtians in former times uſed to pray with their faces Eaſtward, becauſe in the Chancel, which was the Eaſt part of the Church, ſtood the Holy Table, where the higheſt of Religious Services were uſually performed, and the Sacrament of Chriſt's
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:51624:41"/>body and bloud was adminiſtred, which is the ſpecial ſign of God's myſterious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. The <hi>Jews</hi> at the reading of the Law, and other Scriptures, looked toward the people; but in Prayer, toward the Mercy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeat, or principal part of the Temple, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 28.2. and Chriſtians may in all probability do the like, in imitation of the <hi>Jews;</hi> for as their Mercy-ſeat was a type and figure of Chriſt, ſo the Holy Table, and the Sacred Myſteries there performed, are repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of him in a more ſpecial manner. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did the <hi>Jews,</hi> nor do the Chriſtians, this out of any ſuperſtitious conceit, that God cannot or will not hear our Prayers, unleſs we look Eaſtward when we pray, as the <hi>Jews</hi> looked toward the Oracle or Mercy-ſeat, for we know God is Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent, every where preſent; yet for all this, Chriſt directed us by his form of prayer to look towards Heaven, when we pray, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the Throne of God.</p>

            <p>The Church in appointing Hymns, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves punctually the rule of the Apoſtle, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3.16. and from the practice of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, who ſung Hymns together, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.30. probably to teach and inſtruct us to do the like, may the Antiquity of them in the Chriſtian Church be derived. We have not only Chriſt's example for it, and the Apoſtles command for it, but we read of it practiſed in the Church of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> which was founded by St. <hi>Mark;</hi> St. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi> brought Hymns into the Church of <hi>Millain;</hi> God (ſaith <hi>Jerom</hi>) is delighted with Morning and Evening Hymns; St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> (as we read in the Life of him) was very much afflicted a little before his death, as for the decay of other things in Religion, and in the publick worſhip of God, ſo that the Hymns and Lauds uſed to
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:51624:43"/>be ſung to God, were loſt out of the Church. Thoſe Hymns were either ſaid, or ſung, but more properly ſung, becauſe Hymns are Songs of Praiſe; and it was the practice to ſing them both in the Jewiſh, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 47.6. and Chriſtian Church, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.30. for ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing enflames and enlivens the minds and affections of the hearers; and ſuch muſick by pleaſing the affections, and delighting the minds of men, makes the Service of God more delectable, and leſs tedious. And for this reaſon is Church-Service ſo intermixed with Leſſons, Pſalms, and Prayers, and like the garment of the Spouſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. made up of ſuch variety, that by this variety our devotions may be carried on with the more chearfulneſs, and the greater appetite, and without any faſtidiouſneſs. Standing was the uſual poſture for the ſaying or ſinging of Hymns, for it is indeed the moſt proper poſture for thankſgiving or laud, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 134.1, 2. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7.6. and this erection of our bodies, doth moſt properly expreſs the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of our hearts in joy, praiſes, and Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt unto God. The forementioned Hymn, called <hi>Te Deum laudamus,</hi> was compoſed (as it is ſaid) by St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> and St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine,</hi> which they uſed to ſing Anthem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; and the occaſion of its compoſition, was St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi>'s Converſion and Baptiſm,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:51624:43"/>in both which St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> was moſt happily inſtrumental. But be the Author who it will, the Structure, though Humane, is complete, and the materials of it are Divine; and it is worthily enough vouchſafed a place in our conſtant Service, for its Antiquity, for its conſonancy with Scripture, for having the Churches both warrant and approbation; for the contents of it, which are moſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, hugely advantageous for the height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Devotion, and promoting of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; wherein is acknowledged the Power and Majeſty of God the Father, the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Humanity of God the Son, his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation, Paſſion, Reſurrection, Aſcenſion, Exaltation to Glory, and Power committed to him for to guide, rule, preſerve and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern his Church; and wherein alſo is aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the Divinity of God the Holy Ghoſt; and there is nothing in the whole Hymn, but what is very agreeable to Scripture. Some exception may be made, againſt this expreſſion in it, <hi>When thou hadſt overcome the ſharpneſs of death, thou didſt open the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven to all believers:</hi> But what can juſtly be found fault with in this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion? by it we do not expreſs this to be our meaning, as if we thought that the departed Saints were not in a ſtate of bliſs and happineſs, before Chriſt's Aſcenſion;
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:51624:44"/>but our meaning is rather, that Chriſt by his Aſcenſion prepared a greater, and more complete ſtate of bliſs, for thoſe that are his, meriting their going to it by his Death, and making the way paſſable by his Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Aſcenſion, <hi>John</hi> 3.13. <hi>John</hi> 14.2, 3. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.8, 12. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.19, 20. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.40. for by this means he procured greater Grace for them here, greater Glory for them here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. Whatever he did or ſuffer'd, the end was to open the kingdom, which our ſins had ſhut up; which he opened moſt libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally at his Aſcenſion, and after he had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the ſharpneſs of death, for then he took a local poſſeſſion of Glory, for the uſe of all that are his. Be the ſtate of the Saints departed before what it will, yet what God beſtowed upon their Souls, was procured by Chriſt's Death, Reſurrection and Aſcenſion, which followed after; as alſo the Glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of their bodies, is moſt certainly to follow the Exaltation of his; whither the glory of the Head is gone before, the hope of the Body is to follow after, and when our bodies and ſouls come to be glorified to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, then ſhall we be in our complete and perfect bliſs. <hi>Glory be to the Father,</hi> is not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned to be uſed at the end of this Hymn, becauſe it is it ſelf almoſt nothing elſe but that Doxology enlarged.</p>

            <p>This Song, or Hymn, commonly called the Song of the Three Children, is word for word to be found in the Apocryphal Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and was uſed to be read by Chriſtians in their publick Congregations, as a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Formulary of pious thoughts, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions, and prayers, fit to be uſed in times of remarkable deliverances, vouchſafed from great dangers. The names of the Three Children, mentioned in the cloſe of this Hymn, are to be met with in the Book of <hi>Daniel,</hi> which is received for Canonical, <hi>Dan.</hi> 1.6. and the occaſion why this Pſalm of Praiſe was at firſt compoſed, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.25. In the Apocryphal Book of <hi>Daniel,</hi> this
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:51624:46"/>Hymn is ſet down word for word, (as is before noted) which Apocryphal Books were anciently of very great eſteem in the Church, and were publickly read in the Congregations, for inſtruction in life and manners. However, as appears by the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited Texts, this Hymn is exactly agreeable with Canonical Scripture, and the Ancient Fathers did highly approve of it; neither is there in it any thing liable to a juſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, for it is only a methodical and full Compendium of the great and glorious Works of God; and the whole ſcope of it is to ſhew, that God is, and will be magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in all his Creatures. We do not in it ſpeak to the Creatures, for to inſtruct them what they ſhould do; but we rather ſpeak of them, to teach our ſelves what is our duty, that is, to glorifie God together; and therefore do we conclude it with, <hi>Glory be to the Father,</hi> that we may actually do it.</p>

            <head>EXPLANATION.</head>
            <p>Let it be here noted once for all, that the <hi>Benedictus</hi> of <hi>Zachary,</hi> and <hi>Pſalm</hi> the 100. for the Morning Service after the Second Leſſon; and the <hi>Magnificat</hi> of <hi>Mary, Luk.</hi> 1.46. with <hi>Pſalm</hi> the 98. after the Firſt Leſſon in the Evening Service; and the <hi>Nunc Dimittis, Luk.</hi> 2.29. and <hi>Pſalm</hi> the 67. after the Second Leſſon, are ordered to be read as the Miniſter ſhall make his choice, This or That; and however theſe Hymns or Pſalms were compoſed upon occaſion of particular benefits, yet are they always of ſingular uſe in the Church of God. The forementioned Hymns are frequently uſed in our publick Service, becauſe they are the Hymns wherewith our bleſſed Saviour was joyfully received, at his firſt entrance into this world; and they do ſomewhat more concern us, then <hi>Davids</hi> Pſalms do, becauſe the Goſpel and New Teſtament is of more concern to us, then the Law and the Old. Theſe Hymns are proper only to Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, whereas the Pſalms are common to the Jews and Chriſtians. The Pſalms are Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies and Predictions of Chriſt, who was to come; theſe Hymns are plain diſcoveries of Chriſt, who is come. They are the firſt
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:51624:48"/>gratulatory Hymns, which welcomed into the world our born Saviour: And though they were moſt ſeaſonable then, when they were firſt compoſed and ſung; yet we may profitably enough uſe them ſtill, as well as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> in publick Service commanded the Songs of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Aſaph</hi> to be uſed, which were compoſed long time before, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.30. For the promiſes and performances of God, are not ſo reſtrained to particular perſons, but others alſo may go ſharers in them, in regard of the myſtical union of all the faithful; and however the particular occaſion may ceaſe, yet the fountain of goodneſs and mercy is ever the ſame: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, by frequent uſing of the praiſes of the Saints, our minds may daily more and more be inured and enflamed with their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And the Church hath very fitly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Hymns after Leſſons; for when we have heard God out of the Leſſons, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as it were from Heaven to our Souls, how can we do leſs then riſe up and praiſe him? and with what Hymns can we praiſe him better for our Salvation, then with thoſe which were the firſt gratulations of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour? As for the Hymn and <hi>Benedictus</hi> of <hi>Zachary,</hi> it was indeed compoſed by reaſon of Chriſt's birth, and manifeſtation in our fleſh; which <hi>Zachary,</hi> the Author of it, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetically
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:51624:48"/>foreſaw, and therefore compoſed it for to entertain Chriſt withall. Yet though the occaſion of it was, or rather was not, particular, we may convert it to a common uſe, as well as the Epiſtles of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> which were moſt of them written upon ſpecial oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions. Neither can that occaſion be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed particular, where the benefit is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon; for the birth of Chriſt as much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns us, as it did <hi>Zachary;</hi> and therefore we may ſay it, or ſing it, and were juſtly to be blamed in caſe we ſhould refuſe the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo. The 100 Pſalm is joyned with it, and the Miniſter may make his choice of either, becauſe both are Thankſgivings unto God, enforced almoſt with the very ſame reaſons and arguments.</p>

            <head>EXPLANATION.</head>
            <p>This is called the Creed, or Belief, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all neceſſary points to be credited or believed, in order to our Salvation, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it. It is the Key of the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, an Abridgment of the Goſpel; Chriſt taught it the Apoſtles, the Apoſtles taught it the Church, and the Church us. Though it be not Canonical Scripture, as to the make, yet as to the matter contained in it, it is; for it contains in it the very Scripture, Word, and Truth of God. It is of greater Authority then any other Eccleſiaſtical Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of this nature, whether they are Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions of particular Churches, or Writings of private men. The <hi>Nicene</hi> and <hi>Athanaſian</hi> Confeſſions, mentioned and uſed in our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy, are not new Creeds, but larger Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications of this. It is called the Apoſtles Creed, either becauſe they themſelves uſed it, or becauſe it contains the heads of that Doctrine which they taught the world; and it is the Judgment of ſome very learned men, that it is more Ancient then many writings of the New Teſtament. At firſt perhaps it was no part of the Liturgy, or publick Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, only a preſcribed Leſſon for the <hi>Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chumens</hi> to be inſtructed in, and whereof
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:51624:50"/>they were to make publick rehearſal, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to their admiſſion unto Baptiſm. There is mention made of it in the moſt Ancient writers of the Church; and however ſome objections may be made againſt the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licalneſs of it, yet thoſe objections certainly are not unanſwerable. But however, moſt certain it is, that it is ſo Apoſtolical, as to the matter, that it may without offence carry its denomination from the Apoſtles, and be called their Creed; becauſe it is a moſt excellent Epitome and Abridgment of their Doctrine, contrived in a very near re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance to their Language, and a great part of it undoubtedly digeſted by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolical Church. For if the Apoſtolical Churches had not this very Creed in expreſs words, yet they had a Creed very much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling this, as to the ſubſtance of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, though with ſome few ſyllabical va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riations. If at any time the Articles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Holy Ghoſt, and the Church, were omitted in the Creed, yet they were ſupplied from the form of Catechizing then in uſe; which form was in truth a Creed, and with the rehearſal of which the <hi>Catechu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens</hi> were Baptized. Though not in <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian,</hi> yet in <hi>Cyprian</hi> we find expreſs men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Holy Church, Remiſſion of ſins, and everlaſting life; but then indeed, as it
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:51624:50"/>is noted by <hi>Jerom,</hi> all the myſteries of the Chriſtian Faith, were upon the matter ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated in the Reſurrection of the fleſh, into which they were baptized, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.19. and with it <hi>Tertullian</hi> concludes his rule of Faith; yet was not the Article of <hi>Life ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting,</hi> any after-new addition, only it was repreſented in a different order. Let but the <hi>African</hi> parcels of <hi>Tertullian</hi> and <hi>Cyprian,</hi> be united together, and a Creed may be found, as to the Eſſentials, conformable to this of the Apoſtles; and the like may be found in the Epiſtles of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> who was diſciple to one of them. Neither was there any need for the Apoſtles, or Fathers, to commit this Creed to writing, in regard it was the great <hi>depoſitum</hi> of the Church, conveyed down from one Age to another in a Traditional way; ſuppoſed by ſome to be the one Faith, mentioned <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.5. and the form, pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern, or ſummary of ſound words, mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13. the body of Faith made up in all its proportions, mentioned <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.6. and the Faith which was once delivered to the Saints, mentioned <hi>Jude</hi> verſ. 3. This Creed, and the other two, the <hi>Nicene</hi> and the <hi>Athanaſian,</hi> which are but Explanations of this, are ordered to be ſaid after the Leſſons, to ſhew that Faith comes by Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Hearing by the Word of God,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:51624:51"/>
               <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.17. we muſt firſt hear, and then confeſs; and they are ordered to be ſaid ſtanding, becauſe they are ſummaries of the Goſpel, which was ever rehearſed in that poſture; and becauſe the <hi>Catechumens</hi> uſed to make rehearſal of their Faith in a ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing poſture: which poſture is alſo ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, and notes that gallant reſolution which ought to be in us, to maintain and defend that Faith and Religion which we profeſs.</p>

He is ſo Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, that he is liable to no imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:51624:51"/>and his Almightineſs appears remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly in the Creation of the World, for he is the Maker of heaven and earth. He made ſomething of nothing, and out of that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing he made all things; the glorious Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, Angels, and Spirits; the Starry Heaven, Sun, Moon, and leſſer Lights, with all the glorious Conſtellations; the Airy Heaven, winged Fowls, Clouds and Vapours; Hail, and feather'd Snow, Rain, Lightning, and terrible Thunder. He made alſo the Earth, Land and Sea, Graſs, Herbs, Plants and Trees, Beaſts, Birds and Fiſhes: he made Man to praiſe him, and glorifie him in all, and for all; to magnifie God in all his works, and never to diſtruſt him, who hath proved himſelf thus Omnipotent. <hi>And in Jeſus Chriſt his onely Son our Lord;</hi> I believe alſo in the ſecond perſon of the Godhead, the Word and Wiſdom of God; who is ſtiled <hi>Jeſus,</hi> to note him a Saviour: which name was given him by an Angel, together with the meaning of it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 1.21. He is alſo ſtiled <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which is an appellative title of office and dignity, given to him for three purpoſes; 1. To note him an anointed King, to judge, govern, defend us, and to ſave us from danger. 2. An anointed Prophet, to teach, inſtruct us, and to ſave us from errour. 3. An anointed High-Prieſt, to offer
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:51624:52"/>up himſelf for us, and his prayers for us, to make Interceſſion to the Father for us, and to ſave us from ſin. He is God the Father's <hi>Onely Son,</hi> not by Creation, as men are; nor by Adoption, as good men are; nor by Office, grace and favour, as Kings and Judges are; but by Nature, as none other are ſave only himſelf: he is God of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his Father before all Worlds, God of God, very God of very God, and a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct perſon in the Godhead from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. <hi>John</hi> 1.1. He is alſo <hi>Our Lord,</hi> 1. In reſpect of Creation, for he hath dominion over us as he is God. 2. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Redemption, for he hath dominion over us as he is God and Man. It was God the Son, not God the Father, nor God the Holy Ghoſt, who did perſonally pay the ranſom of our ſins, purchaſe our freedom from the ſlavery of Satan by his own bloud, and by the everlaſting efficacy of the ſame bloud once ſhed, doth waſh and nouriſh us, not as his Servants, but as the Sons of God our heavenly Father. As he is <hi>Jeſus,</hi> we are to ſue and ſeek to him for Salvation, for there is no Salvation in any other, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.12. as he is <hi>Chriſt,</hi> we are to pay all ſubjection to him as a King, to hear and obey him as a Prophet, to reſt upon his Sacrifice, Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and Interceſſion as a Prieſt. As he
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:51624:52"/>is Gods only Son, we are to pay him that honour which we pay to the Father; and as he is our Lord, we are to quit Sin and Satan, and to pay to him our real Service. <hi>Who was conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin</hi> Mary; In this Article is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, how the Son of God became the Son of man, in order to make ſatisfaction to God for man's ſin, to reconcile God to man, and to work about man's Redemption; to put him into a ſalvable condition, and to render him again capable of thoſe fruitions, which he in <hi>Adam</hi> had deprived himſelf of by his diſobedience. In this Article is to be noted more particularly, 1. The myſtery of Chriſt's holy Incarnation. 2ly. His holy Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity and Circumciſion, together with his Baptiſm, Faſting and Temptation. This Son of God, who was very God, begotten and not made, being of the ſame ſubſtance with his Father, by whom all things were made, for us men, and for our Salvation, came down from Heaven, and was conceived and incarnate by the Holy Ghoſt of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and was made Man; and as he was made Man in her, ſo he was born of her: God became Man, and yet remained God; he took our Humane nature, yet did not lay aſide his Divine; and <hi>Mary</hi> became a Mother, and yet remained a Virgin ſtill;
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:51624:53"/>Chriſt of her took our Humanity, without the loſs of her Virginity. He was conceived without ſin, that he might cleanſe and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie our ſinful conceptions. He was born without ſin, that he might ſanctifie the birth of us, who are born in ſin, and with ſin; and as he was ſinleſs from his birth, ſo the life which he lived here on earth, was a ſinleſs and innocent life; that by the ſinleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and obedience of his life, he might make ſome kind of amends for the ſinfulneſs and diſobedience of ours. Yet he was Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, though nothing was ſuperfluous in him, that ſo amends might be made in that part by him for Original ſin, by which it is propagated. And he was Baptized, though nothing in him was unclean, that he by his Baptiſm might ſanctifie the element of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and make it, by the Holy Spirit joyned to it, virtual to cleanſe us not only from Original guilt, but as we are fitly capable, from all actual pollutions. And he was tempted, by all thoſe ways of Temptation which we are liable and expoſed to, that he might in his own perſon overcome the Tempter, and grand Seducer, and teach us by his example how to behave our ſelves ſucceſsfully, and to the beſt advantage, in all our Temptations. By the ſame Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, whereby he was conceived in the bleſſed
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:51624:53"/>Virgin <hi>Maries</hi> womb, is he to be conceived in our hearts; which hearts we are to keep as pure and undefiled, as the holy Virgin was, in order to his conception: we are to prepare Virgin hearts for Chriſt to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and born in, and for the Holy Ghoſt to overſhadow; by which Virgin hearts is not to be meant, an abſolute ſinleſs purity and innocence, which only <hi>Adam</hi> in his created eſtate, and Chriſt could yield; but a renewed purity, and recovered Virginity by Repentance, joyned with ſincere reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and holy purpoſes of amendment of life, and humility typified in the temper of New-born babes: For theſe are the only due qualifications, which can fit and prepare the Soul for the Holy Spirit to overſhadow it, and for Chriſt to be favoured in it. As Chriſt took our nature upon him, and was pleaſed to be born of a pure Virgin, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the help of man, which ſhewed him to be the true Seed of the woman, that ſhould break the Serpents head, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. ſo we are to pray for Gods regenerating grace, that we may be made his children by Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Grace, and be daily renewed and changed in our Spirits, by his Holy Spirit. As Chriſt was Circumciſed, and by that bloudy ceremony made obedient to the Law for us; ſo we are to pray for the true Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:51624:54"/>of the Spirit, that our hearts and all our members being mortified from all worldly and carnal luſts, we may in all things obey Gods bleſſed will. As Chriſt was Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, not to be cleanſed by the waters, but to cleanſe the waters, that they might cleanſe us; ſo we are to come to his Holy Baptiſm, to be waſhed in thoſe ſtreams, the Fountain whereof he himſelf hath opened, and conſecrated not ſo much for the clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of our bodies, and putting off the filth of the fleſh, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21. as for the ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of our hearts from an evil conſcience, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.22. that our hearts being pure, our actions may be pure alſo. And when we are thus cleanſed, we ought to take ſpecial care and heed, that we return not like the Dog to lick up our vomit again, or like the Swine to our former pollutions, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.22. and ſo become the fouler for our once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cleanſed, and be drowned in that Holy Laver, which was deſigned for our preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Laſtly, as Chriſt was tempted, and that he might overcome the Tempter, did for our ſake, and in part for our example too, Faſt even to a miracle; ſo we are to pray unto God for his Grace, to direct and aſſiſt us in all our Temptations, that we may uſe ſuch abſtinence, as to bring our fleſh in ſubjection to the Spirit, and ever obey the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:51624:54"/>Godly motions of Gods holy Spirit, living in righteouſneſs and true holineſs, to the praiſe and glory of him. <hi>Suffered under</hi> Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius Pilate, <hi>was crucified, dead and buried;</hi> The great end and deſign of Chriſt's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into this world, was that he might ſuffer, and by his ſufferings make ſatisfaction to Divine Juſtice for man's ſin. He did not ſuffer becauſe he was himſelf a ſinner, but becauſe he became a Surety for us, who are ſo. He ſuffered for our ſins, not for his own: He being righteous died for us, who are unrighteous, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.21, 22. this he did for our ſake, and for our example and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement. He hath given us in himſelf an example of enduring the higheſt afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; which example, ſo far as imitable, is to be imitated and tranſcribed by us, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.21. From the manner of his death we are taught the great doctrine of Mortification, to put off the body of the ſins of the fleſh, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.11. to deſtroy the body of ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.6. to put our ſinful habits to a contume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious death, to crucifie the fleſh, with the affections and luſts; and in ſo doing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form our ſelves exactly to the ſufferings of Chriſt, through all the gradations of it, that ſo we may be planted with him in the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.5. As a conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was held againſt Chriſt, as he was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:51624:55"/>examined, accuſed, condemned, ſhamed and crucified; ſo ſtrictly and ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhould we deal with our Old man, our whole body of ſin: we ſhould conſult deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berately about its execution, chuſe our moſt ſober ſeaſons for the doing of it, when we are in the calmeſt temper of Soul: and we are to proceed orderly to act againſt ſin; to apprehend it, to ſtop every courſe and habit of it in its career; we are to examine it by the Word of God, by the commands of Chriſt, in all its variations from, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions to them. This done, we are to accuſe it, and in ſo doing, to aggravate it with all the heightning circumſtances of guilt and danger: Then by a ſolemn full conſent of all the faculties, we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn this dangerous Malefactor, to ſpit upon it with contempt and ſcorn, to give it up to be crucified, never to revive again to any vital actions. Neither are we to be thus ſevere againſt our ſingle habit of ſin only, but againſt the whole body of ſin, and all its parts and members. Again, from the manner of Chriſt's death we are inſtructed further, to take up our Croſs voluntarily and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, when it is laid upon us, to follow Chriſt in his ſufferings, and to conform our ſelves really to the image of our crucified Saviour; for if we are thus partakers of
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:51624:55"/>his ſufferings, we ſhall be alſo partakers of his enjoyments. He went by the Croſs to his Crown, paſſed through ignominies and ſufferings, into his Glory; ſo ſhould we. Again, he was dead, that by his dying he might deſtroy death, and ſanctifie the ſtate of death to all his Servants. Death loſt its ſting in his ſide, and ſo became to all, who are his, but as a calm ſleep. Laſtly, he was buried, to ſhew that he was really dead; and as his body was removed out of ſight, ſo we are to put all our ſinful habits, like dead bodies, out of the way, that they may neither offend nor infect others. He conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ſome time in the Grave, to note unto us the reality and continuance of our mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified ſtate; and that we ſhould not only once for all repent and mortifie, but keep in our Souls a continued death unto ſin, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and unfeigned, till we are riſen again to the other Diviner life, to live unto God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, as he roſe again to live unto God. <hi>He deſcended into Hell, the third day he roſe again from the dead;</hi> Here began Chriſt's exaltation, after his abaſement and diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: His deſcent into Hell, was the firſt part of his advancement. As his body, not ſeparated from his Divinity, reſted in the Grave; ſo his Soul, united to his Divinity, had ſomething further to do. He deſcended
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:51624:56"/>not to ſuffer, but to conquer. As he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the World on Earth, Death in the Grave; ſo he triumphed over Satan in Hell, and within the Territories of his own King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: he went into Satans quarters, and openly ſhewed him the Victory, which by death he had gotten over him, over death it ſelf, and over all the Powers of darkneſs. However, certain it is, that he remained ſome time in the ſtate of the dead, his living Soul being ſeparated from his dead body. This Article of Chriſt's deſcent, is as true as all the reſt, though perhaps not ſo capable as the reſt, of any binding interpretation to be put upon it: Therefore we paſs this part of the Article by, and come to the latter part, <hi>The third day he roſe again from the dead;</hi> that is, within the ſpace of leſs then ſeventy two hours, and before his body ſaw corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he roſe again; that fleſh, which he laid down in the Grave, he by his own power raiſed up again from the Grave. As his dying ſhewed his Humanity, ſo his riſing again de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared his Divinity; by which Reſurrection of his, not only his Godhead was demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.4. but the all-ſufficient Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of his death and paſſion for ſin, was fully evidenced and declared; for had there remained but one ſin unſatisfied for, which he came to make ſatisfaction for, that one
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:51624:56"/>ſin might have kept him from riſing. The Reſurrection of Chriſt ſhewed, that a full ſatisfaction was made for ſin by his death, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.17. Again, Chriſt's Reſurrection is the ground of ours: as <hi>Adam</hi> brought death into the world to kill us, ſo Chriſt brought Reſurrection into the world to give us life, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.22. Chriſt is riſen as the Head, we ſhall follow as the Members; Chriſt is riſen as the Firſt-fruits, we ſhall follow as the Harveſt. Again, the Reſurrection of Chriſt is a proof of our Juſtification before God; for he is to be conſidered as a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick perſon, both in his Death, and in his Reſurrection, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.25. Laſtly, his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection from the Grave, ſhould mind us of our Reſurrection from ſin, which brought him to it. Our actual riſing to new life, is as neceſſary as mortification; as Chriſt roſe from the dead to dye no more, ſo we being dead to ſin, ſhould riſe to newneſs of life, and live unto God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.10, 11. As he after his Reſurrection appeared unto men, ſo ſhould we, and walk exemplarily before them in heavenly living. We ſhould conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in a ſanctified ſtate of perſeverance in Godly living, till by Gods mercy we are taken up to bliſs: We ſhould depend upon Chriſt for our Juſtification and Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which are both of the effects of his ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:51624:57"/>We ſhould alſo haſten our Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as he did his, and not ſo immerſe our ſelves with ſorrow and humiliation, the Grave of mortified Souls, as to hinder any actions and vital performances of the new and regenerate life. As Chriſt dyed, and as we are baptized into the death of Chriſt; ſo we are to beg of God for his grace, that we may continually mortifie our corrupt affections, and being buried with him, may paſs through the grave and gate of death, to our joyful Reſurrection. <hi>He aſcended into Heaven, and fitteth on the right hand of God the Father Almighty;</hi> that is, after his Reſurrection, when he had made his appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance ſeveral times to his Apoſtles, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm them in the truth of it, whom he had choſen for the publication of it unto the world; after he had given them many ſure proofs and evidences that he was riſen, after he had talked with them about the affairs of his Church, which ſhould be planted and governed by them, and of many things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Goſpel, and his Kingdom, and how both his friends and his enemies ſhould be dealt withall; after he had eaten and drank, and familiarly converſed with them, thereby to give them all poſſible aſſurance of the truth of his Reſurrection, of his Power and Godhead, and that he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:51624:57"/>the undoubted <hi>Meſſias;</hi> after that he had inſtructed them to tarry at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to wait for the coming down of the Holy Ghoſt, and how to prepare themſelves for his reception; after he had reproved them for their curioſity, and ſhewn their vanity in expecting a Kingdom, which he never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to ſet up; then in the preſence and ſight of them all, he was taken up by Angels from the earth in a bright ſhining cloud, which incloſed him ſo that they could ſee him no more, <hi>Act.</hi> 1.2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. He carried up our nature, which he had aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, in which he ſuffered, and which he had raiſed out of the Grave, up on high above all Heavens, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.10. offer'd it up to the Father as an acceptable oblation, who placed it on a glorious Throne at his right hand. And as he deſcended on purpoſe to do us good, to beſtow and ſcatter his graces amongſt us; ſo he aſcended alſo upon a good deſign for us, that he might ſend down the Holy Ghoſt upon his Apoſtles, and by that means ſupply all our wants, and do what was neceſſary to be done for the plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and governing of his Church. The place he aſcended from, was Mount <hi>Olivet;</hi> the place he aſcended to, was the higheſt Heavens. The time of his Aſcenſion, was ſourty days after his Reſurrection; the truth
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:51624:58"/>of it appears from the evidence of thoſe who ſaw it, and are able to give a good teſtimony of it; the manner of it was glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and the end of it hugely advantageous, and beneficial to us. But the practical Uſe, which we are to make of Chriſt's Aſcenſion, and Seſſion at the Father's right hand, is this; 1. As we believe that he is aſcended into the Heavens corporally, ſo we are ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually in hearts and minds to aſcend after him, and to dwell continually with him in Divine meditations, carrying heavenly minds in earthly bodies; ſeeking, minding, ſavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring things above at the right hand of God, where Chriſt ſits, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3.1. where Chriſt our treaſure is, there ſhould our hearts be alſo. 2. Seeing he hath withdrawn his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral preſence, we are to content our ſelves with his ſpiritual; not to hang on his bodily preſence, the preſence of his Manhood, as it was viſible to the eye; but to acquieſce in his ſpiritual preſence, the preſence of his Godhead, and the preſence of his Manhood too, united to his Godhead, yet no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe preſent then ſpiritually and by Faith; for though his Godhead be every where, yet his Manhood in a corporeal and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſenſe cannot be every where, but only where it is placed at the right hand of God. Let us ſpiritually ſee him aſcending, cordially
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:51624:58"/>believe in him abſent, wait and hope with patience for his coming again, and by his ſecret mercy feel and enjoy him ſpiritually preſent with us. And ſeeing he ſits at Gods right hand, and is exalted with great tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph into his kingdom in Heaven; whereby is noted his Reign, and his being inveſted with all power in the union of his Regal and Prieſtly Office, by virtue of which he gives commands to his Church, intercedes with God for his Church, and that ſo powerfully, as actually to beſtow that grace and pardon, which he intercedes for, making continual Interceſſion with God, who is his Father and ours: This ſhould teach us, to give up our ſelves obediently to be ruled by him in all his holy inſtitutions and commands, and to be guided by all thoſe, whom he hath placed in his Church under him to rule over us; This ſhould alſo teach us, to depend upon his Interceſſion, to offer up all our prayers and praiſes to God in and through him only: This ſhould teach us, to be in a readineſs to receive all Grace that ſhall flow from him, and to make the holieſt uſe, and beſt advantage of it. Laſtly, This ſhould teach us, to have recourſe to him in all temptations, and to perſevere in deſpight of all aſſaults to the contrary; to have our eye upon him in all that ever we do, to improve
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:51624:59"/>thoſe Talents well, which he beſtows upon us: for as he is gone to Heaven, he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn again from Heaven to judge the world. <hi>From thence he ſhall come to judge the quick and the dead;</hi> The very ſame Jeſus Chriſt, who is gone up to Heaven in glorious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, ſhall come one day from Heaven again in as glorious a manner to judge us, <hi>Act.</hi> 1.11. His going up to Heaven, was not an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute departing from us, only he went to take poſſeſſion of that Kingdom of his, which he ſhall exerciſe to the end of the world; and then he ſhall return again to judge all men, without reſpect of perſons; all that are dead, and all that ſhall then be found alive; all Nations of men in their order, and every man of every Nation, ſhall give up their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts to him, and ſhall receive according to what they have done in the fleſh, be it good or bad. To thoſe who by patient con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance in well-doing, ſeek for glory and honour, and immortality, ſhall be given the reward of eternal life; but to thoſe who are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteouſneſs, the retribution ſhall be indignation and wrath: tribulation and anguiſh ſhall be upon every Soul of man that doth evil; but glory, honour and peace to every man that worketh good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.7, 8, 9, 10. Now the expectation of Chriſt's
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:51624:59"/>coming to Judgment ſhould teach us, to be conſtant in making up our accounts againſt his coming, as perſons daily expecting a righteous, though a gracious Judge, to ſit upon us. He is one, who will come in flames of fire, and in great wrath, to take ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance on his Adverſaries, and upon all who do not obey the Goſpel; one who will not only ſift our actions, but ſearch our very hearts and reins; who will not ſuffer any one ſin to be carried along under the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe of Religion, or on confidence of his favour, but will come from his Throne of Mercy in Heaven, and ſit upon his Throne of Juſtice here upon the Earth, to judge all his provokers; one who will not be moved with paſſions, bribes, flatteries, to puniſh or reward according to any other method or rule, but only this, of every man according to his works, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.6. This one would think ſhould bring us to a pious awe of him, reſtrain us from ſin, keep us in good courſes, and make us work out our Salvation with fear and trembling. <hi>I believe in the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> who is God, a diſtinct perſon in the Godhead from the Father and the Son, and proceeding from both. In reſpect of Nature, the Father is holy, and the Son holy, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is a Spirit, and the Son is a Spirit; but in regard of Office, the third perſon in the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:51624:60"/>Trinity is eminently ſtiled the Holy Ghoſt, or Holy Spirit. He is ſtiled the <hi>Holy,</hi> 1. From the holineſs of his Nature: 2. From the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of his Office; whoſe ſpecial Office it is to make the Church holy: The Father ſanctifies by the Son and by the Holy Ghoſt, the Son ſanctifies from the Father by the Holy Ghoſt, the Holy Ghoſt ſanctifies from the Father and the Son immediately by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Again, he is ſtiled the <hi>Spirit,</hi> 1. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his Nature, which is ſpiritual. 2. In regard of his proceſſion from the Father and the Son, being as it were inſpired and brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed from both. 3. In regard of his opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and manner of working, for he inſpires and breaths into us holy motions and deſires to good things, and is the Fountain and Spring of all ſpiritual life in us. This Holy Spirit is holy in himſelf, pure from all ſin, pollution, corruption, hypocriſie, partiality, and that moſt eminently; and he is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of all holineſs and purity in us, which he works in us by two ways of diſpenſation: 1. Outward, 2. Inward. His outward diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation was in moſt eminent manner, when he deſcended viſibly upon the Apoſtles, filled them with Graces, and furniſhed them with Powers to plant, preſerve, and govern the Church of Chriſt over the World. The Powers which he inveſted the Apoſtles with,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:51624:60"/>were theſe; 1. To preach the Goſpel. 2. To baptize thoſe Nations, which embraced it. 3. To confirm thoſe, whom they had bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed. 4. To admit thoſe to the Sacrament of Chriſt's body and bloud, whom they had confirmed. 5. To exerciſe the powers of the Keys in Cenſures, in puniſhing the pertina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and caſting thoſe out of the Church, who would not conform to the rules and orders of it, that ſo they might be aſhamed, and be made to reform their wicked lives, and be capable of being received in again by Abſolution, upon their ſincere repentance evidenced by their Reformation. 6. To or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain others, and to commit the ſame powers to them, which the Holy Ghoſt had ſettled in themſelves, and ſo to continue a ſettled Miniſtry by ſucceſſion unto the end of the world. In reſpect of all theſe forementioned donations, the Holy Ghoſt is ſtiled a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clete; by which word we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, 1. An Advocate, 2. A Comforter, 3. An Exhorter and Inſtructer. Now the Holy Ghoſt is to be conſidered as an Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, 1. In reſpect of Chriſt, 2. In reſpect of Chriſtians. Now the Holy Ghoſt is Chriſt's Advocate, in pleading his cauſe againſt the incredulous world, by a threefold con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, <hi>John</hi> 16.8. 1. Of Sin, and that great crime of not receiving Chriſt, but rejecting
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:51624:61"/>him, who was teſtified and demonſtrated by the coming down of the Holy Spirit after his Aſcenſion, to be a true Prophet. 2. Of Righteouſneſs, to convince the world that Chriſt was a righteous perſon, and unjuſtly crucified, as appeared by his Aſſumption into Heaven, and participation of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Glory. 3. Of Judgment, to convince all men, that Chriſt, who was judged in the world, ſhall judge the world, and paſs ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence upon the Devil the Prince of this world, who was the firſt contriver of his death, and upon all who ſide with him, and take his part. Again, as the Holy Ghoſt is Chriſt's Advocate, ſo is he alſo the Advocate of all Chriſtians; 1. In ſettling a Miniſtry, to pray and intercede for their ſeveral Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, and enabling them to form a Liturgy to be continued in the Church to that end, thereby helping our infirmities, and teaching us to pray as we ought. 2. In ſanctifying thoſe Prayers, which the Church daily offers up to the only true God, by the only true Mediator Jeſus Chriſt, that ſo they may be offered up with acceptance to the Father, by Chriſt our Mediator. Again, as the Holy Ghoſt is an Advocate, ſo is he alſo a Comforter; for by power and abilities beſtowed upon men, the comfortable news of the Goſpel, the promiſes of pardon and
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:51624:61"/>grace are divulged to thoſe, who want com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. Laſtly, the Holy Ghoſt is our Exhorter and Inſtructer, in exhorting us to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, to fly from ſin, and the wrath to come, and to walk worthy of the great vocation and calling of our Chriſtianity, unto which we are called; and by exerciſing all exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal means, which belong to his Titles and Offices, for the working of all manner of ſanctity in our hearts; and by uſing all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward means, ſecret preventions, incitations, over-ſhadowings, and all other aſſiſtances, which are abſolutely neceſſary to beget and continue holineſs in our hearts: All which do attend upon his outward miniſtrations before-mentioned, and conſtantly go along with them, to hollow them to all worthy receivers, and obedient diſciples. Now to believe in the Holy Ghoſt, is to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the truth of all that is before made mention of; and to accommodate our pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice accordingly, and to conform to this Faith: 1. By ſubmitting our ſelves to thoſe Spiritual Paſtors, whom the Holy Ghoſt hath ſet over us; as they themſelves are to be careful of that Flock, whereof the Holy Ghoſt hath made them Overſeers. 2. By not intruding into, and uſurping upon the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Function and Miniſtry, nor meddling in it without a lawful call, and ſuch as may
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:51624:62"/>juſtifie it ſelf to be from Heaven. 3. By obeying all the ſeveral Powers, which the Church is inveſted with. 4. By devout hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Word. 5. By due preparing our ſelves for Baptiſm, and bringing others to it. 6. By fitting our ſelves for Confirmation. 7. By examining our ſelves, that we may come fitly prepared to the Lords Supper. 8. By fearing the Church-cenſures; and if we are at any time under them, by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, Contrition, works of Mercy, and all kind of Reformation of our lives, to labour for Abſolution; and in all theſe humbly to beg of God his ſpecial grace, that it may go along with all theſe outward ordinances; and diligently to watch, obſerve, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it in the uſe of them, and to lay it up in honeſt hearts, that we may bring forth fruits with patience, neither reſiſting, nor repelling, nor grieving, nor quenching this Holy Spirit of God, whereby we are ſealed (if we do not betray our ſelves) unto the day of complete Redemption, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.30. <hi>The holy Catholick Church, the Communion of Saints;</hi> As the firſt part of the Creed was chiefly concerning God, ſo the latter part of it is principally relating to the Church of God; as we begin with God in our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Faith, ſo we end with the Church; for unleſs we are of the Church, we ſhall
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:51624:62"/>loſe our intereſt in God. Now by <hi>Church</hi> in this place we are to underſtand, a ſociety of Believers ruled and continued according to all the ordinances before-mentioned, of the Holy Ghoſt's ſettling and eſtabliſhing; which Church is deſcribed by theſe three proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Holy, Catholick, a Communion of Saints. 1. The Church is remarkably ſaid to be Holy, in reſpect of the holy Powers and Offices, which are ſettled in it, and upon it; in reſpect of the Holy Ghoſt, the author and founder of them; in reſpect of Chriſt the Head of it, who is moſt holy; in reſpect of the Faith of the Church, which is in it ſelf holy, and makes us holy; in reſpect of that ſanctity and holineſs of life, which ought to be in all the Members of it; in reſpect of the great deſign in the firſt conſtitution of it, which was to beget and to increaſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs. 2. The Church is remarkably ſaid to be Catholick, which word ſignifies, 1. Orthodoxal, as having Truth in it; and ſo it is diſtinguiſhed from the Societies of Hereticks and Schiſmaticks, wherein is er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and falſhood. 2. Univerſal, diſperſed and extended all the world over; and ſo it is diſtinguiſhed from the Church of the <hi>Jews,</hi> which was an incloſure divided from all the world beſide: It is Univerſal alſo in reſpect of the ſame Faith, which it teaches
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:51624:63"/>to all men, in all places, and at all times; and in reſpect of the ſame Laws and Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, according to which all Reformations ought to be made; otherwiſe they will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be rather Innovations then Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, an introducing of new things, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then a reſtoring of the old. Laſtly, the Church is remarkably ſaid to be a Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Saints, in reſpect of the Communion of Faith and Laws, in reſpect of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Sanctity and Holineſs, which ought to be in all the Members of it, and in reſpect of the communications of Charity; Firſt, Corporal charity, to all the Fellow-members of Chriſt that are in need; Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Spiritual charity, expreſſed to mens ſouls by advice, counſel, reprehenſion, ſpiritual conference, and in any kind of effuſion of Grace from God to us; in praying with and for one another, in praiſing God with and for one another; which laſt is a duty conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued mutually betwixt us and the glorified Saints in Heaven, ſo far as is moſt commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to the condition of each. As the Saints in reſt and joy, and advanced towards the Throne of Glory in Heaven, pray for their younger brethren on Earth; ſo the Saints who are yet in the Camp, and Militant on Earth, praiſe God for thoſe revelations of his Grace and Glory, which he hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:51624:63"/>upon their elder brethren in Heaven. As the Saints and Members of the Church, hold communion with Chriſt the Head, have intereſt in all his benefits, go ſharers in the common Salvation; ſo do they hold com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion one with another. As in the body natural, ſo in Chriſt's myſtical body the Church, there is a perpetual ſympathy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the parts; if one Member ſuffer, all ſuffer with it; if one be had in honour, all rejoyce with it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.26. Neither doth death it ſelf diſſolve this communion, for the knot of fellowſhip holds between the Saints departed this world, and thoſe who ſtill remain in it. The departed Saints pray to God for our good in general, and we praiſe God for their good in particular; we praiſe God for giving them ſuch eminent graces on Earth, and ſuch unſpeakable glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in Heaven; in affections and hearts we converſe with them, we love their memories, uſe all innocent means to have their exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary lives propounded to us for our imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; we deſire to be diſſolved, and to be with Chriſt and them; and we judge it the greateſt honour that we can do them, to imitate their pious and holy lives: and that we may do this, in our annual day of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration for All-Saints, we pray, That as God hath knit together his Elect in one
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:51624:64"/>communion and fellowſhip, in the myſtical body of his Son Chriſt our Lord; ſo he would grant us grace ſo to follow his bleſſed Saints in all vertuous and godly living, that we may come to thoſe unſpeakable joys, which he hath prepared for them who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feignedly love him, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord. <hi>The forgiveneſs of ſins;</hi> That is, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that by the death and ſufferings of Chriſt, there is pardon and remiſſion to be had in the Church, for all true penitent ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; which pardon, all true penitens, upon exact examination of themſelves, may be able to pronounce unto themſelves; but the Miniſter, whoſe office it is upon a clear view of conſcience, ſo far as is fairly poſſible, may pronounce it more authoritatively, yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them can do it infallibly: ſo that as to their pronouncing, Remiſſion of ſins is not properly a matter of Faith, neither can it well be. But the matter of Faith, which is contained in this Article, is this; To be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the forfeiting of our perfect un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinning innocence in Paradiſe, ſhall not be able to exclude us from Gods favour and grace here, nor from Heaven hereafter, if we ſincerely turn from ſin, and return to God; for God is pleaſed to accept of Chriſt's ſufferings, as a meet and meritorious ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for all true penitent ſinners. We are
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:51624:64"/>born in ſin, and we grow from ſin to ſin, from bad to worſe naturally, and it is by the grace of God that our ſins are remitted; which remiſſion is conveyed to us, whilſt we are in the Church, and continue Church-Members, by Prayer, the Word, and the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments. This Remiſſion is not to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to our merit, but to Gods mercy, who beholds all true penitent Chriſtians in Chriſt, and upon their unfeigned repentance and amendment, reputes their ſins as no ſins. But that we may have our ſins pardoned and forgiven, it concerns us to ſet our ſelves ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely and induſtriouſly to the performance of thoſe conditions, upon which remiſſion of ſins is to be had; to repent of them, to reform from them, to amend our lives, to fly ſin, and to follow ſanctity; to continue in a full aſſurance of hope towards God, that if we perform our parts, God in Chriſt will never fail in his; To pray to God in Chriſt daily for his mercy; to continue in the moſt melting ſtate of humility and meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, always remembring that all the good we do, or can attain to in this life or the next, is not to be imputed to us, or to any thing in us, but is wholly to be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the purchaſe of Chriſt, who hath by his paſſion and ſufferings alone, delivered us from the puniſhment of our ſins; which
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:51624:65"/>puniſhment is the deprivation of Gods grace here, and of the viſion of God hereafter. For all the ſtrength, which any Chriſtian hath to reſiſt any ſin, is but a conſequent of Gods being reconciled to us in Chriſt, and for his ſake not imputing to us our treſpaſſes. <hi>The Reſurrection of the body;</hi> That is, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that this fleſh of ours, which by the curſe of God inflicted on ſin, goes down to the Grave, ſhall moſt certainly be raiſed again out of the Grave; though it be the puniſhment of all mankind, by reaſon of <hi>Adam</hi>'s fall, to be mortal and to dye, yet this puniſhment is removed, and allayed by Chriſt, in reſpect of all his faithful Servants; the bitter and noxious part of death is taken away, ſo far as concerns them; the ſting of death is plucked out, and the Grave is turned into a place of repoſe and reſt, where their bodies ſhall ſleep until they are awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened unto bliſs. That power which raiſed up Jeſus, will raiſe up us alſo. God, who fetched all out of nothing by his word, can by the laſt Trump call all of us out of the duſt, and reſtore our bodies again to us, however they may be changed, or tranſmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Chriſt is riſen as the Firſt-fruits, the heap will follow; Chriſt is riſen as the Head, the body will follow: and if it ſhould not be ſo, our bodies, which are both the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:51624:65"/>and co-partners of all ſin, and of all righteous actions and ſufferings, would be left unpuniſhed and unrewarded. Now the belief of the Reſurrection of the body ſhould teach us, to keep our bodies in a riſing condition; not by uncleanneſs, drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keneſs, worldly-mindedneſs or floth, to nail our hearts, and to faſten our affections to the Earth; but by purity, ſobriety, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly-mindedneſs, and an holy induſtry, to fit our bodies for that Heavenly and Divine condition, to which after the Grave we hope to be advanced. And to pray to God for this perfection and bliſs, not only for our ſelves, but for all others, who are already entred into Gods reſt, that ſouls and bodies joyned, may dwell together in the heavenly and endleſs life of bliſs and glory. <hi>And the life everlaſting;</hi> This is the chief good, and laſt end which we gain by being in the Church, and true Members of it, <hi>Life ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting:</hi> all men on earth have life, but it is not everlaſting life; the damned in Hell ſhall have that, which is everlaſting, but it ſhall be death rather then life, for they ſhall be tyed perpetually unto torments; only the true Members of the Church ſhall attain to life everlaſting, an inheritance purchaſed for them by Chriſt; and yet is it alſo, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that purchaſe, Gods free do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation:
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:51624:66"/>if we begin with God, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue Members of his Church, this will be our end, <hi>Everlaſting life.</hi> The life we lead here, is finite, ſhort, and feeble; but the life which ſhall follow the Reſurrection of the body, will be infinite, everlaſting, an endleſs ſtate in endleſs bliſs to every true penitent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, and of endleſs woe to all contuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious provokers. How ſhould this teach us ſeriouſly to weigh, and ſoberly to conſider theſe two diſtant ſtates, and to be careful not to forfeit our intereſt in the one, nor for a little tranſitory joy, honour, and gain, or eaſe for a few minutes here, to incur the danger of the other? How ſhould this teach us ſo to uſe and improve that moment of life, which we have here, that it may be made a foundation of Eternity? God hath ſet before us life and death, and ſeems to have left either of them too, to our own option and choice. And if it be ſo, then if we will not accept of the terms and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon which life is offered us, we muſt of neceſſity for our deſpiſing life, fall into death. Certainly men, as men, were neither created nor decreed abſolutely to Heaven or Hell; for Heaven is our crown, not our fate; our reward, not our deſtiny: ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is Hell our fate or deſtiny, but our pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. God, who made us rational men,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:51624:66"/>provided alſo for us rational rewards, and rational puniſhments; ſo that if we miſs of Heaven, happineſs and bliſs, and Hell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come our portion, it will be for our own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault; it muſt be our own wretched con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, which deprives us of the one, and brings us to the other. There is an Eternity of joy to be had upon a very rational and eaſie obedience, and an Eternity of miſery belongs only to thoſe, who fall in love with thoſe things which will inevitably make them miſerable. God made not death for man, but he created Paradiſe for him; the everlaſting fire was prepared firſt for the Devil and his Angels, and ungodly men by their own words and works, made it to become their portion; they did as it were commit a Riot upon Hell, and invade <hi>Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer</hi>'s peculiar. And it is a ſad thing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, how fooliſh men will ſtrive more ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently for a ſad portion in the burning Lake, and endure more for Hell, then for Heaven; take more pains for Eternal death, then for Everlaſting life. Now although all is true which is expreſly contained in the Creed, and we may ſay <hi>Amen,</hi> give our free and full aſſent to the truth and certainty of it, and that there is an <hi>Everlaſting life,</hi> is as true as any Article in the Creed beſide; yet it is to be preſumed, that there are two ſorts
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:51624:67"/>of wicked men, who ſhall never come to this life everlaſting. 1. Wicked Infidels, who believe contrary to the Faith of Chriſt. 2. Wicked Believers, who live contrary to it. They who would have life everlaſting, muſt have it upon thoſe terms and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, upon which it is offered; that is, not only upon the condition of a ſound Faith, but alſo of a ſincere obedience, as it is written, <hi>If thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments,</hi> Mat. 19.17.</p>

            <p>The forementioned Prayers delivered in the very Scripture phraſe, are Chriſtian Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutations very well becoming the people of God, and paſſing reciprocally betwixt Prieſt and People: The like in ordinary uſe among us are, <hi>God ſave you, God ſpeed you, God bleſs you, Pſal.</hi> 129.8. 2 <hi>John</hi> 10. which are not to be thought idle Complements, whereby we take the name of God in vain; but Chriſtian and commendable civilities and duties, which were commonly uſed and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed by Chriſtians in the time of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, 2 <hi>John</hi> 10, 11. In the Liturgies of St. <hi>James, Baſil, Chryſostom,</hi> and the <hi>Aethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pians,</hi> the Prieſt was wont to ſay, <hi>Peace be unto you;</hi> to which the People replied, <hi>And with thy Spirit.</hi> In the old Liturgy of <hi>Spain</hi> called <hi>Mozarabe,</hi> (becauſe the Chriſtians were mingled with <hi>Arabians</hi>) the Prieſt ſaid, <hi>The Lord be with you;</hi> the People an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <hi>And with thy Spirit.</hi> the Prieſt again ſaid, <hi>Help me brethren in your prayers;</hi> and the People anſwered, <hi>The Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt help thee. Petrus Damianus</hi> wrote a whole Book upon this argument, intituled, <hi>The Lord be with you.</hi> It was uſed in the Latine Church, ever ſince their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:51624:68"/>was compoſed by <hi>Damaſus,</hi> and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be deduced out of the Greek Church into the Latine; it is of very an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient uſe, and is one of the firſt <hi>Formula</hi>'s of devotion uſed in the Chriſtian Church; at firſt it belonged only to the Miniſters of the lower Order; and when the Biſhop did offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate, he uſed in place thereof, <hi>Peace be unto you;</hi> but in the <hi>Braccarian</hi> Council it was decreed, that the Biſhop and Presbyter ſhould uſe one and the ſame form, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined the form to be this, <hi>The Lord be with you;</hi> adding this, As it is uſed in all the Orient: which ſhews the cuſtom to be changed ſince <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi>'s time, or elſe we muſt reject a great part of his Works for counterfeit. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> ſaith, that this form of Salutation was derived from our Saviour's firſt greeting of his Apoſtles, after his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, <hi>John</hi> 20.19. However, it did an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently denote a tranſition from one part of the Service unto another, as it is here ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed by our Church for the very ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Theſe mutual and reciprocal Saluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, were prudently and Chriſtianly made a part of the publick Service, to continue that agreement and love, which ought to be between Paſtor and People; and the very order of it ſhews, that it is the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters office to begin, and the peoples duty
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:51624:68"/>to correſpond in all good affections and kindneſs; when the Miniſter is as <hi>Paul,</hi> the people ſhould be as <hi>Galathians,</hi> chap. 4.15. not only reverence his place, but alſo love his perſon: The Paſtor cannot wiſh a better wiſh then this, <hi>The Lord be with you;</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can the people make a fitter reply then this, <hi>And with thy Spirit:</hi> To note, that he is to offer up a ſpiritual Service and Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice unto God, and to do it ardently and affectionately; which he cannot do, unleſs God be with him, by his Grace and holy Spirit to aid and aſſiſt him. Now Chriſt hath promiſed to be with his Apoſtles and their ſucceſſors, unto the end of the world, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.20. to be with his Church in her devotions, in the midſt of us, or amongſt us, when we offer up our Services to him: but if our Spirits be not right fixed, ſo as to intend and mind what we are about, how can God be with us? How can God be with our Spirits, if our Spirits are not with God? How can God be in the midſt of us, when we are not in the midſt of our ſelves? Therefore this clauſe, <hi>Let us pray,</hi> is very often repeated in the Service, upon any no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> table tranſition from one eminent part of Service to another, to fix us to our devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and to make us the more intent upon what we do; for we are apt to be dull
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:51624:69"/>enough in Sacred duties, unleſs we are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently call'd upon to mind ſeriouſly what we are about. It was anciently the Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons office to pronounce it, and therefore he was ſaid to <hi>preach,</hi> or to <hi>proclaim</hi> the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; for it was his office by loud voice, or proclamation, to warn the people in ſeveral parts of the Service, what was done, or to be done, that accordingly they might order themſelves both in their hearts, and in their bodies, ſuitable to that which was done or performed by Chriſt's Miniſters, that ſo all things might be done with good order, and due reverence. The Heathens in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Offices had a cuſtom, not much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering from this; for they had their Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers and Proclaimers of their Service for the ſame purpoſe, to regulate the carriage and behaviour of the people, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent confuſion. The three following Verſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, <hi>Lord have mercy, &amp;c.</hi> were called by the Ancients, the Leſſer Litany; and they are fitly placed before the Lords Prayer, becauſe in our reſort to him in Prayer, it is very expedient that we firſt implore the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

            <head>EXPLANATION.</head>
            <p>The forementioned Prayers are all agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Scripture, of Divine derivation, and becauſe they are moſt what taken out of the Book of Pſalms, the Prieſt is ordered to ſtand up at the reading of them; they are ſhort, and in that reſpect conformable to Scripture pattern, and Primitive practice. The interchangable way of praying is uſed here, and often elſewhere in our Divine Offices, which is agreeable to Primitive pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice alſo; and the end of it is, to refreſh the peoples attention, to teach them their part in the publick Prayers, to unite their affections, and to keep them in a league of perpetual amity. In theſe Prayers we pray firſt for the King, next for the Miniſters of Chriſt, Prieſts and Deacons, and in the laſt place for the People; and in all we follow that excellent pattern, which was ſet us by the Royal Prophet <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 132.1, 9.
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:51624:71"/>And although it may be our good happineſs to live in a time of Peace, yet we pray con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly for Peace in our time, in the ſame ſenſe as we pray in the Lords Prayer for daily bread, when we have it by us; we pray that it may come where it is not, and that it may continue where it is; we pray alſo for the bleſſing of peace, as well as for peace it ſelf. And although we pray in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs terms for peace in our time, yet we do not forget poſterity, only we dare not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume that it ſhall remain with us, with her wings clipt, for ever; as we ask for bread this day, and yet we neglect not to morrow, only we follow the rule of our Saviour, who forbids us anxiouſly to take care for to morrow. And whereas it is added in the foregoing Prayers, <hi>Becauſe no other fighteth for us, but only thou, O God:</hi> our meaning is, that we fear not War, but hope for an eternal Peace of God to defend us; we acknowledge him our Shield, our Watch-Tower, and our Keeper, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.2. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 121.4. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 127.1. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.25. and that there is none that holds with us, but <hi>Michael</hi> our Prince, <hi>Dan.</hi> 10.21. that is, Chriſt. Though Angels and men may fight in our quarrel, yet they all do it but as God's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments; God only fights for us as princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Agent: He it is, who teacheth our hands
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:51624:72"/>to War, and our fingers to fight, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.34. And in regard that without Chriſt's aſſiſting us with his holy Spirit, we can do nothing, for he is firſt and laſt, we can neither begin nor end well without him; therefore as we begin, ſo we end with God: Firſt, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire God to be with us, and with our Spirit; and in the laſt place, we deſire of God that he would not take his holy Spirit from us.</p>

            <p>Collects are ſo called, becauſe they are Prayers in ſhort ſums, containing much matter in few words, like ſo many choice
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:51624:73"/>Flowers gathered and collected out of the Scriptures Garden, and bound up in little Poſies to be offer'd and preſented to God by Jeſus Chriſt. The firſt Collect here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned for the day, is always fitted to the day, and framed for the moſt part in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to ſomething remarkable in the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle and Goſpel for the day, which the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect is ſet before. The ſecond Collect is for Peace, becauſe we cannot well pray, nor offer up an acceptable Sacrifice to God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Peace; where there is no Peace, there is no Piety, Godlineſs, nor Honeſty; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we pray for Peace, that the reſt may be preſerved, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1, 2.

            <p>Touching the variety of Service, Anthems and Hymns to be ſung by way of Antipho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny or Reſponſe, I have ſpoken ſomething before, and therefore ſhall ſay nothing in this place. Indeed here I might have inſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Anthems, which are daily uſed in the Cathedral and moſt eminent Churches, but I conſider'd it to be needleſs, in regard per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons upon enquiry may meet with them bound up all together. The forementioned Prayers I have not here Scriptur'd out, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe moſt of them, as to the matter and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of them, will fall within the Litany, which I ſhall warrant by Scripture ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:51624:75"/>But here let it be noted, that we pray in particular for Kings, in purſuance of that precept of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1, 2, 3. which is preſſed and urged with this reaſon, that we may lead quiet and peaceable lives in all godlineſs and honeſty; which can hardly be done, if Kings and eminent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in Authority, do not help towards it. Good Kings promote Religion wicked Kings perſecute it: <hi>Joſiah</hi> and <hi>Hezekiah</hi> did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe true worſhippers, as <hi>Jeroboam</hi> did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe and multiply falſe and Schiſmatical ones. A good King, is a very great bleſſing; but ſo unhappy are we, that we cannot know the worth of him, unleſs it be in the want of him. We pray for the Church, which is excellently deſcribed by Biſhops, Curates, and the people committed to their charge, all which make up a Church rightly conſtituted; and <hi>Ignatius</hi> the Diſciple of St. <hi>John</hi> the Evangeliſt, tells us, that there can be no truly conſtituted Church without a Biſhop. By Curates here are not meant Stipendiaries, but all Miniſters to whom the Biſhop hath committed the cure and care of Souls. For the right conſtituting of a Church, and for the preſerving of it when it is conſtituted and ſettled, we pray for the healthful Spirit of Gods grace to be poured down upon all, who profeſs Chriſt, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:51624:75"/>Chriſtianity with ſincerity. The terms wherein we pray, may ſeem ſtrange, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard we preſent our prayers to the <hi>Almighty and everlasting God, who only worketh great marvels;</hi> but this expreſſion hath a peculiar reference to Gods ſending down of his holy Spirit upon the Apoſtles, whereby they were enabled to ſpeak in all Languages the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful works of God, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.11. and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirm that Doctrine by Miracles, which they taught the world. The Prayer of St. <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom,</hi> who lived about the fourth Century, is grounded upon <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. v. 19, 20. and may be met with word for word in his Liturgy. We begin and end the Morning Service with the Apoſtle; as we begin the Exhortation in an Apoſtolical ſtile, ſo we conclude the Prayers with an Apoſtolical Prayer; and conclude moſt of our Prayers and Collects with this clauſe, <hi>Through Jeſus Christ our Lord,</hi> becauſe there is no coming to God but by Chriſt; what we ask (as we ought) in his Name, God will give us for his ſake. He is our <hi>Jacobs</hi> Ladder, by whom our Prayers aſcend to God, and Gods bleſſings deſcend to us; all good things come from God the Father, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>

            <head>Hereunto is added by way of Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix, theſe following Paraphraſes.</head>
            <div n="1" type="paraphrase">
               <head>1. <hi>A Paraphraſe upon</hi> Pſal. 95.</head>
               <p>Verſ. 1. THe great God of Heaven is he, from whom all our deliverance and ſtrength doth come; O let us uniformly joyn in praiſing and glorifying his Name.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 2. Let us make our daily conſtant addreſſes to him, with all the acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and expreſſions of thankful hearts.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 3. For he is the Supreme God of Heaven and Earth, the only ſuper-eminent Monarch over all Powers and Dignities, to whom Angels in Heaven are Miniſters, and the mightieſt Princes upon the Earth are Vice-gerents.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 4. The bowels and bottom of the Earth are in his diſpoſal, and ſo are the loftieſt and ſtouteſt Hills; by which it is alſo intimated, that the meaneſt and loweſt men or creatures on Earth, are particularly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by his providence in all that befalls them here, and the mightieſt men in the world are bounded and governed by him.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 5. It is he, that framed the whole Orb of the Sea and dry Land, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:51624:78" rendition="simple:additions"/>them the one within the bowels of the other, that they ſhould not incommode each the other, but both together make up one uſeful Globe for men, and all other creatures to inhabit.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 6. O let us joyntly adore, praiſe, and pray unto him, and make the members of our bodies, partners and witneſſes of the real devotion of our hearts; let us joyn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and outward reverence together, in the moſt ſubmiſs and lowlieſt geſtures, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſignifying and expreſſing the ſincere hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility of our Souls, which is a tribute moſt juſtly due to him, who is the great Lord and Creator of all.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 7, 8. And although we have often rebelled againſt him, and ſo have often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved his dereliction, and as often ſmarted for it; yet if now at length we ſhall be wrought upon by his calls and warning, and perform unto him ſincere obedience, he is moſt ready to accept us, to take us into his care and protection; and to ſecure us from all our enemies.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 9. But let not us, like our provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king fore-fathers, who being delivered by him, ſinned yet more againſt him, after we have ſo liberally taſted of his power, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and long-ſufferance, and after his many gracious calls afforded us to Repentance,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:51624:79"/>rebell againſt him, and provoke his wrath, by imitating them in their ingratitude and impenitence.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 10, 11. For fourty years together, wherein for their ſins God detained and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed them in the wilderneſs, they did fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently provoke God to indignation, and made him reſolve that they were a ſtupid Idolatrous people, preferring the worſhip of falſe Gods and Devils, before the obedience and worſhip of him the only true God of Heaven and Earth; therefore being as it were tired out with their continued provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, God obliged himſelf by an Oath irreverſibly, that of the many thouſands which came out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> only two perſons, who were grown up to be men, ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Land of Promiſe: O let not us fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them in their ſins, leſt we follow them alſo in their puniſhments, and ſo fall ſhort of Heaven, as they did of <hi>Canaan.</hi>

               <p>Verſ. 68. ALl glory, honour and praiſe be unto the great Lord and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious God of his choſen people and ſelect inheritance, for he hath performed his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe ſo often made to them, by his gracious
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:51624:79"/>Viſitation, in bringing them out of <hi>Aegypt</hi> formerly by a temporal deliverance, which did pre-figure a greater deliverance to be wrought by Chriſt the promiſed <hi>Meſſias,</hi> who is ſhortly to be born.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 69. Of <hi>David</hi>'s Family, and inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted with all power, honour, glory, dignity and triumph, to be a King, Ruler, and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent deliverer of his people, whoſe Kingdom is not Secular, but Spiritual.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 70, 71. Of whom honourable men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made by all the holy Prophets of God, ſpeaking of him as with one mouth, from the beginning of that age, which was before the coming of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> unto this preſent time. The end of whoſe coming is to ſave us from all our ſpiritual enemies, ſins and dangers, by taking upon him our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and in it performing perfect unſinning obedience, by dying upon the Croſs for us, and by giving us precepts and rules by their own inward goodneſs moſt agreeable to our reaſonable nature, for the purifying of our affections, and for teaching and inſtructing us to lead pure lives.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 72. By all which God hath made good his ſignal promiſe of mercy, made to the holy Fathers and Patriarchs, wherein both themſelves and their Seed were highly concerned.</p>
               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:51624:80"/>
               <p>Verſ. 73. Eſpecially that great and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Covenant of mercy, which he made to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed in a Spiritual ſenſe, and ratified and confirmed by the Sanction of an Oath.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 74, 75. Namely, that he would give us power, ability and grace, in and from the <hi>Meſſias</hi> revealed, to obey and attend him in a ſincere performance of all duties to God and man, and chearfully and conſtantly to perſevere therein, being by him reſcued and ſecured from all dangers of enemies with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out us, though not altogether from thoſe, which may be founded in our ſelves, in our own negligences and miſcarriages.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 76. And thou Child (meaning <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi>) ſhalt be a wonderful perſon, and extraordinary Prophet of God; for thou ſhalt foretell Judgments on the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, if they repent not ſpeedily, and in a ſignal manner ſhalt point out Chriſt, being his immediate fore-runner, and ſhalt preach Repentance and amendment of life, thereby to fit and prepare men for him.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 77. Teaching all men, that in Chriſt there is a poſſibility for ſinners to obtain Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and to have their ſins pardon'd, upon their Repentance and New life.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 78. Which is a ſpecial act of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, and ſignal mercy in God; through
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:51624:80"/>which mercy the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> who is called the Day-ſpring by the Prophets, is come from Heaven to viſit us, and to abide amongſt us.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 79. And to ſhine forth to blind ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant mortals, and obdurate worldlings, who lived in a ſtate of ſin and death; and to bring them and us into the way of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity and Holineſs, which leads to Salvation and life eternal.</p>

               <p>Verſ. 3. For this is the only way to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with the great and glorious, and omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent Creator of all things, to whom we owe all that we have, and all that we are; to him we owe our being, conduct, and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and to him we are obliged to pay all the obedience and obſervance, which the meekeſt creatures in nature pay to thoſe, who have the care and conduct of them.</p>

               <p>Verſ. 5. For to do this, we have all imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable obligations, not only that of his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign dominion over all, to which all the performances of our lives are but a moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportionable tribute; but alſo his abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant benignity, his rich promiſes of a never-failing mercy, and his conſtant fidelity of performing to every man, who is fitly quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for receiving it, the utmoſt that he ever promiſed to any.</p>

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:51624:82"/>that they are manifeſtly oppoſed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded by him; and by his only power, without any helper, hath he now wrought a great and glorious work.

               <p>Verſ. 52. It is ordinary with him to abaſe the lofty Atheiſts, however high they are raiſed in might and power; and to advance humble perſons, though they are of never ſo low degree.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 53. He takes the poor, who depend upon him, into his protection, and reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth them with all neceſſaries, when they call upon him; whereas the rich men of the world, who truſt in their uncertain riches, are often brought into want and beggery.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 54, 55. He hath now performed his promiſe made to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed; hath exhibited to them, and to all the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving world, the great promiſed mercy; and hath made ſuch a proviſion for them, which ſhall never fail, having ſent the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> the Saviour of the world ſo long expected, which is a mercy that ſhall never be taken from us: Therefore for this unſpeakable
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:51624:83"/>mercy, and for all mercies flowing from this, Glory ſhall be aſcribed to God in all the Churches of his Saints, and that for ever.</p>

               <p>Verſ. 6.

God Father, Word, and Holy Ghoſt, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.7. Three, and yet but one; three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and yet but one God. This Myſtery of the Trinity, ſaith <hi>Bernard,</hi> is to be embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by Faith, not ſearched into by Reaſon. I believe, ſaith he, the eternal and bleſſed Trinity, though I underſtand it not; and apprehend that by Faith, which I cannot
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:51624:90"/>comprehend by Reaſon. Many of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have undertaken to give us ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umbrations of this Myſtery, which yet can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſeen clearly, and therefore ought not to be examined curiouſly. <hi>Tertullian</hi> hath ſhadowed it forth by the ſame Sun, in its body, beams, and light; <hi>Lactantius,</hi> by the ſame water, in its Fountain, Spring, and Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> by the ſame Soul, in its un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, memory, and will; <hi>Baſil,</hi> by the three diſtinct colours in the Rain-bow; <hi>Jerome,</hi> by the ſame hand, arm, and fingers; <hi>Meletius,</hi> by three fingers: And the Hand which appeared to <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> upon the wall, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5.5. was a hand with three fingers, ſay ſome Expoſitors upon the place. Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane eloquence, ſaith St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> hath la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured much in this Myſtery, but wanted words to expreſs it. Yet however Reaſon cannot inſtruct us to know what is hid, it ſhould direct us to believe what is revealed in Scripture concerning this Myſtery. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks have endeavoured to break this myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious knot, which they were not able to untie; yet they themſelves have been bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and this Myſtery is preſerved. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> Scholar to St. <hi>John</hi> the Evangeliſt, hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended it in his Epiſtles; ſo hath <hi>Vincentius Lyrinenſis,</hi> in his Golden Treatiſe; ſo have <hi>Tertullian</hi> and St. <hi>Augustine,</hi> in their Books
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:51624:91"/>written of it; ſo <hi>Athanaſius</hi> in his moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Treatiſe, entituled, <hi>God the Word in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate;</hi> and more eminent writers, which I forbear now to mention. We read, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. <hi>ver.</hi> 21. ſome men, who were far enough from being good men, charged by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who did ſo far miſtake God, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves too, that they thought God like themſelves, when they were not themſelves. I know that place is properly applicable to men of the moſt vitious lives, and putrified manners, to ſuch as deny God, at leaſt in their practiſes; yet it may after a ſort be applyed to thoſe alſo, who miſtake him upon another account, and preſume to be too fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar with him, only becauſe they are not well inſtructed to know their diſtance; who diſcourſe of God, and of Religion, as of common things, and by ſo doing draw con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and irreverence towards both. To advance the reputation of Religion, and to gain it that reſpect and reverence, which it ought to have, we muſt advance the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God firſt, and ſhew him to be ſuch a one as is rather to be admired and adored, then to be drawn into a low eſteem by our over-much familiarity. This Creed ſerves now for ſuch a purpoſe, it being framed up not ſo much to advance our knowledge, as to edifie our reverence, that we may have
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:51624:91"/>more humble and reverend conceits of God, and of Religion too, when we ſhall ſee how much fools we are, though we may take our ſelves to be very wiſe men, and that all the knowledge we have of God, in reſpect of that which we cannot know, is but igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. This Creed may ſerve to check that pride which is ſo radicated in our natures, that we preſume to be acquainted with all the ways, methods, and operations of God, with all Religion, and all that is Religious; whereas, though revealed to us by the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and the Scriptures, we know very little of God himſelf. The greateſt part of what we know of him, is but the leaſt part of what we know not of him: There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in God, but what is very myſterious; he was not God, if he could be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended; not only the myſtery of Godlineſs, which takes up the latter part of this Creed, is a great myſtery, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. but the myſtery of the Godhead, which takes up the former part, is alſo a very great myſtery. Now this ſhould beget in us fear and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, that we have ſuch a God to do with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all upon all good occaſions, who when he is brought the cleareſt down to our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, is yet above it. The more he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veals himſelf to us, the more is he hid from us; he cloaths himſelf with light, yet we can
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:51624:92"/>ſee nothing but the dark ſide of him; that which reveals other things to us, hides him from us: He is not far from us, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.27. yet he is out of our reach: He makes his approaches to us, and yet is unapproachable, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.16. He is viſible in his works, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.19, 20. and yet inviſible in himſelf, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.16. He gives himſelf ſeveral names, and this amongſt the reſt, <hi>I am that I am, Exod.</hi> 3.14. as to ſhew him a God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changable, ſo to ſhew him a God unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. The three great works wherein he was moſt manifeſt, are Creation, Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Sanctification; wherein we admire three, and are to adore but one; we may diſcover three Perſons, and yet we muſt pay our Devotions and Adorations but to one God. In the Creation we have three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons creating, yet but one Creator: The creation of the matter, is aſcribed to the power of the Father; the diſpoſition of the form, to the wiſdom of the Son; the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the whole, to the love of the Holy Ghoſt. The Perſons are three, and yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable; acting by a ſtrange order in theſe three great works, yet acting inſeparably. In the firſt of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> where the Creation is ſet down briefly, yet fully too, we have <hi>Elohim</hi> a noun plural, to note the three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons creating, joyned to <hi>Bara</hi> a verb ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:51624:92"/>to note but one Creator, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.1. So when the great World was epitomized in Man the little, <hi>Let us make,</hi> implies more then one, <hi>in his Image,</hi> notes one and no more, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.26, 27. More Perſons, and one God; all joynt Creators together, yet but one Creator. Ye have the Father creating, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.24. <hi>Job</hi> 38.4. Ye have the Son crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.2, 10. <hi>John</hi> 1.3. Ye have the Holy Ghoſt creating, <hi>Job</hi> 26.13. Ye have all three creating, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.6. <hi>Lord</hi> notes the Father, the <hi>Word</hi> notes the Son, the <hi>Breath</hi> notes the Holy Ghoſt; three, and yet but one: The Father creating by and from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, the Son creating by himſelf but from the Father, the Holy Ghoſt creating by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf but from both: All joynt Creators, and all but one; whence we may learn to give glory to all, in all, and for all, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.36. Indeed this doctrine of the Trinity is a very deep point, the ſearch of it is too high for any mans reaſon; none of the wiſeſt Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, unleſs the <hi>Platoniſts,</hi> and ſome few others, could ever gain ſo little as a happy gueſs at it in broken notions, and thoſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, I ſuppoſe, they had from our Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, wherein we find it ſo clearly revealed, that unleſs we will renounce our Scriptures, and in ſo doing our Chriſtianity too, we muſt give up our Faith to the aſſent of this
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:51624:93"/>doctrine of the Trinity, though we cannot ſound the depth of it. The works of God are wonderful; it is not at all to be admired, if we find ſo great a wonder in God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who is ſtiled <hi>wonderful, Iſa.</hi> 9.6. We who acknowledge a God, muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge this withall, that he can be ſomething, and can do ſomething, which is above our capacities and comprehenſion. That ever any men ſhould become Atheiſts, or Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinitarians upon this ſcore, ſo as to doubt of God or the Trinity, or to deny them, only becauſe they cannot fathom the depth of theſe myſteries, is to me a very ſtrange thing; I ſhould rather think that Atheiſm, and Antichriſtianiſm, and Antitrinitarianiſm, if I may ſo term it, ſhould ariſe from the mean conceits which men have of God; and then do they conceive meanly of him, when they think they can comprehend him, and bring him within the narrow circle and compaſs of their capacities. Thus far I thought good to deliver touching the firſt part of this Creed, the doctrine of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, which we muſt believe, or elſe we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not rightly believe that which follows after; now it follows in good order thus.</p>

                                 <hi>Furthermore, it is neceſſary to everlaſting ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: that he alſo believe rightly the Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 John 4 2, 3.</p>

                                 <hi>For the right Faith is, that we believe and confeſs: that our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Son of God, is God, and Man,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.5. John 1.14. 1 Tim. 3.16. Philip. 2.6, 7.</p>
                              <p>What Chriſt the Son of God undertook to heal, cure, and ſave, that he aſſumed; and what he deſigned to leave in their ruines, he refuſed: therefore he paſſed by the fallen Angels, took not their nature, but took the nature of fallen Man, the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> by way of Aſſumpſit and Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>John</hi> 1.14. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.16. Now we muſt note, that in Chriſt are two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the Divine and the Humane; and as be hath two Natures, ſo he had upon the matter two Nativities alſo: the firſt he had before all Worlds from God and the Father, incorporeal and eternal; the latter he had from the holy Virgin in the end of Ages, corporeal and temporal: according to his Deity he is conſubſtantial to God and the Father, according to his Humanity he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantial to Man and his Mother: as Man he was capable of ſufferings, as God he could not ſuffer; as Man he might be circumſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, as God he is boundleſs, and without limits or dimenſions; as God he could not be made, as Man he was made; as God he was heavenly, as Man earthly; as God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible and intelligible, as Man viſible; as
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:51624:94"/>God incomprehenſible, as Man he might be comprehended. Thus was he whole Man, and whole God, that the whole Man might be reſtored and reformed by him, and the injur'd Deity reconciled and ſatisfied. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was the Word made Fleſh, <hi>John</hi> 1.14. He, who was the Word and not made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all time, was made, and became Fleſh in time, made Fleſh, and manifeſt in the Fleſh. As Man he came to us in the Fleſh, that as the Word he might heal and reſtore that Fleſh and Nature which he aſſumed, was made, and was made manifeſt in. Here was no mocking of us in the caſe, but a real making of him; the holy Virgin, in whom he was made, did conceive him, and not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive us. Neither was the Word made Fleſh by being converted into it, either the Word into the Fleſh, or the Fleſh into the Word, for the Deity cannot be changed into any thing, nor any thing be changed into it. Nor was he made, as men are ſaid to be made Friends, who had formerly been at en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, only by way of reconciliation, ſo as to continue ſtill two diſtinct Perſons, as well as two diſtinct Natures, but his two Natures were made up into one Perſon; ſo that the Word did not ſtand by as a looker-on only, whilſt he ſuffered in the Fleſh, but contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted very much to the price and merit of
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:51624:94"/>his ſufferings. Neither was the Word made Fleſh, God made Man, by ſuch a compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as that a third Perſon ſhould be made out of both theſe Natures, God and Man, which ſhould neither be God nor Man: But he was made by an Aſſumption, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.16. by taking the Manhood up to the Godhead, both his Natures being preſerved without confuſion, and his Perſon entire without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion. He was ſo made Fleſh, that he ſtill remained the Word; he took what before he was not, without changing what before he was; he increaſed what was ours, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt diminution of what was his own; we were the better by this making, he was never the worſe for it; this great Myſtery of Godlineſs, was no detriment to his Godhead; nor the honour done to us the Fleſh, any injury at all to him the Word. This Incarnation of the Son of God, is a Myſtery equal to that of the Trinity, and therefore they who deny the one, will not believe the other; whereas all ſound Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians do firmly believe both.</p>

                              <p>It is a currant Tradition, that the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Creed was compoſed by <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius;</hi> yet Learned men, for ſome reaſons, have ſtrongly oppoſed this Tradition: But be the Author who he will, it is undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ancient, and contains in it the principal Myſteries of Chriſtian Faith; therefore doth the Church approve of it, and admits it into her Liturgy. It is appointed to be ſaid upon certain days, becauſe the ſelect Scriptures made choice of for thoſe days, do treat much of that which this Creed endeavours to explain, <hi>viz.</hi> the Trinity in the Godhead, and the Incarnation of God. Neither did the Author, whoever he was, impoſe this (as I ſuppoſe) as a ſummary of Faith to be believed by others, in thoſe preciſe terms wherein it is expreſſed; only publiſhed it with confidence to declare his own belief, and to ſhew what he himſelf held as point of Doctrine, touching the Trinity of Perſons in the Unity of the Godhead, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation of Chriſt. Neither is the rigid ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of damnation, which is implicitely contained in it, to be extended to all, who believe not every particular in it, in the terms wherein they are expreſſed, for all cannot underſtand them; but it is deſigned
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:51624:97"/>only againſt thoſe, who deny the ſubſtance of this Creed, the Doctrine of the Trinity, the Divinity and Humanity of Chriſt, and the union of his two Natures in one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. For this is undoubtedly a Catholick Doctrine to be believed by all, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs Chriſtianity, without the believing of which, ſo far as cleared and revealed to us, no man can be ſaved. For how is it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for thoſe perſons to come to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who by a miſ-belief oppoſe the ways, means and methods whereby they are to be brought unto it? Now <hi>Glory be to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son, and Holy Ghoſt,</hi> is very properly ſet at the cloſe of this Creed, becauſe it is before proved and cleared in the Greed, that the Father is God, the Son God, and the Holy Ghoſt God; and Divine glory and worſhip belongs to all, and is to be paid to all, by all Chriſtians, as it was from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="173" facs="tcp:51624:103"/>the Church, Emperours, Kings, the Royal Seed, Biſhops, together with the inferiour order of Prieſts and Deacons, and for all things indeed, and perſons which we pray for in this Litany; and Litanies were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly of very ancient uſe, being at firſt compoſed to be ſolemnly uſed for the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſing of Gods wrath in time of publick evils, and for the procuring of his mercy in common benefits; this may be eaſily proved out of <hi>Irenaeus, Proſper, Tertullian, Jeront, Ruffin, Auguſtine, Cyprian, Baſil,</hi> and other Writers of no inferiour note. And they have Scripture ſufficient to warrant the uſe of them, for there is nothing in them prayed for or againſt, which is not grounded upon the Word of God. The firſt Litanies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed were ſhort, but upon occaſions were enlarged by <hi>Mamercus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Vienna,</hi> by <hi>Sidonius Apollinaris</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Averna,</hi> and by <hi>Gregory the Great,</hi> who framed up that which was called the Great Litany, not only upon the ſcore of Reformation, but becauſe much affliction and trouble vexed the world in his time; and Rogations and Litanies were judged meet remedies either to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, or to avert ſuch dangers. After-times might bring Prayers and Rogations into the Litanies, which were not fit to be placed there, nor could eaſily be digeſted by good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaning
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:51624:104"/>Chriſtians; but the Litany uſed by us, is reformed from thoſe abuſes, and there is nothing in it which can be juſtly liable to any exception. It is admirable and nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, both for the matter and method of it, wherein is an excellent particular enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all Chriſtians wants, whether private or common. The contents of it are inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and blameleſs, and the compoſure moſt artificial both to raiſe up devotion, and to keep it up. It directs our Prayers to the right object, the Trinity; it contains in it deprecations againſt all evil, whether of ſin or puniſhment, from which we deſire to be delivered, through the holy actions and paſſions of Chriſt, the only meritorious cauſe of all our good. It contains in it alſo peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for good things, in the putting up of which a very ſit order is obſerved: Firſt, we pray for the Church Univerſal, the common Mother of all Chriſtians; Secondly, we pray for our own National Church, to which next the Univerſal we owe the greateſt obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance and duty. After this we pray for the principal Members of it, the King, the Bloud-Royal, the Clergy, the Nobles, and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, in whoſe welfare the peace of the Church doth chiefly conſiſt. Herein we fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low <hi>Davids</hi> method, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 132. and the Apoſtles preſcribed rule, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1, 2, 3.
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:51624:104"/>and we have many early preſidents of the Chriſtian Church for our ſo doing, as may eaſily be proved out of the Ancient Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies and Fathers. In particular and in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct terms we pray for Biſhops, Prieſts and Deacons, becauſe they were the three Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Clergy eminently diſtinguiſhed in the firſt Ages of the Chriſtian Church, as appears clearly out of the Epiſtles of <hi>Ignatius</hi> and <hi>Clement,</hi> who were both of them Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars and Diſciples to the Apoſtles. And this diſtinction of Biſhops, Prieſts and Deacons, doth directly anſwer to that of High-Prieſts, Prieſts, and Levites under the Law; and the very Heathens themſelves, by the light of Nature, had the like diſtinction amongſt them, called, as they are ſtiled by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28, 29. Teachers, Helpers, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours; as under the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Law and diſpenſation, the Prieſts were to teach, the Levites to help, the Sons of <hi>Aaron</hi> of the Prelatical Order to govern; and the ſame diſtinction of Prieſts to teach, Deacons to help, and Biſhops to govern, hath been ever obſerved in the Church of Chriſt through all Antiquity, as may be proved from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords and Regiſtries in all the Churches. Now whereas we pray, That God would illuminate all Biſhops, Prieſts, and Deacons, our meaning is this, that he would give the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:51624:105"/>beginning of Light to the falſe, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe thereof to the true, that all may be, like <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> burning and ſhining lights, burning in zeal and devotion, ſhining in works of charity and mercy, ſound in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and exemplary in life.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>That it may pleaſe thee to give to all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions unity, peace, and concord,</hi> Pſal. 122.6. Pſal. 133.1. Rom. 14.19.</p>

                              <p>In this Litany we pray particularly for thoſe, who moſt eſpecially need our Prayers, that is, for all thoſe, whom the Law looks upon as miſerable perſons; and were it not
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:51624:106"/>to avoid tediouſneſs, I could fetch almoſt every Paragraph of it out of the Ancient Fathers and Liturgies.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>That it may pleaſe thee to preſerve all that travail by land, or by water, all women labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of child, all ſick perſons and young chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and to ſhew thy pity upon all priſoners and captives;</hi>

                              <p>When we pray for all, who travail by Land or by Water, our meaning is, that God would be aſſiſtant to all, who travail in the way of a lawful calling, and that he would ſeaſonably oppoſe thoſe in their vitious courſes, who do not, and turn them out of the ways of ſin, into the ways of ſafety. When we pray for all women labouring with Child, we pray only for their ſafe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance; if they be honelt women, we pray that God would give them patience to undergo the pains and perils of Child-birth; if otherwiſe, we pray that God would alſo give them the grace of Repentance, that as their Conceptions have been ſinful, ſo their Productions may be ſalutiferous, and the pains of the Body, may work a deep ſorrow upon the Soul, and a Repentance not to be repented of.</p>

                              <p>We pray for thoſe, whom God himſelf hath eſpecially declared in Scripture that he will be careful of, and kind to, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timations of his will and pleaſure, are the beſt directions for our Prayers; neither can we pray more ſuitably to the mind of God, for his pity and compaſſion to be extended to any, then to thoſe miſerable perſons whom he hath expreſly nominated in his Sacred Scriptures, to be the proper and fit objects of his compaſſion and protection; ſo that he is pleaſed to ſtile himſelf, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the fatherleſs, the Husband of the widow, the Helper of the helpleſs, and the Friend of the friendleſs; the only ſuccour and ſure refuge to all miſerable and diſtreſſed perſons, who being deſtituted of the world, ſix their ſole dependance upon him.</p>

                              <p>When we pray that God would have mercy upon all men, we pray for his general mercy to be extended to all, in the ſame ſenſe as he wills all to be ſaved, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1, 2, 3, 4. and in the ſame ſenſe as he is pleaſed to diſtribute out his mercies to all, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.45.</p>

                              <p>In praying for our enemies, we obſerve that ſpecial command given by our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, the obſerving of which commandment, brings us up to the perfection of our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, and makes us moſt like unto God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.44, 45. And becauſe there is no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate luſt in our corrupt nature ſo hard to be mortified, as hatred is, therefore did Chriſt in his Sermon upon the Mount, admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter ſomething expreſly towards the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying of this wicked paſſion; wherein he doth not only take off the edge of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, but he turns it quite the contrary way, teaching us to love our enemies, to bleſs thoſe who curſe us, to do good to thoſe who hate us, to pray for thoſe who deſpite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully uſe us and perſecute us, to love thoſe for Gods ſake, whom perhaps for their own ſake we cannot love. The holy Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth the ſame, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.20, 21. as <hi>Justin Martyr</hi> ſaid to <hi>Trypho</hi> the Jew, Ye perſecute us, and we pray for you.

            <p>And be it noted, that the Litany is no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Service properly, for a Service conſiſts of Pſalms, Leſſons, Creed, Thankſgivings, and Prayers diſtinct, only it is a diſtinct Form, and many times made uſe of as a fit preparative to other enſuing Offices. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly notice was uſed to be given, by the tolling of a Bell, when it was to be ſaid. The accuſtomed days for the ſaying of it, are Sundays, Wedneſdays, Fridays, the three days of Rogation, and other Faſting-days appointed to be obſerved in times of Plague, Famine, War, and other general calamities; and it is a devotional piece of Service very ſuitable to all ſuch times. The uſual place for ſaying of it, where it can be done con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently, is in the midſt of the Church, and juſt before the Chancel-door, the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters turning their faces towards the Altar,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:51624:112"/>or Communion-Table, when they ſay it: For, ſaith <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> it is fit that the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter who officiates in Prayer, ſhould put on the outward garb and deportment, as well as the inward mind of a Supplicant; and therefore he is to be in the kneeling poſture, the poſture of penitents, when he is perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming this penitential Office; and he is to perform it in the appointed place, in imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Prieſts and Miniſters under the Law, who were commanded in their peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tential Service, to weep between the Porch and the Altar, and to ſay, <hi>Spare thy people, O Lord, and give not thine heritage to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, that the heathen ſhould rule over them: wherefore ſhould they ſay among the people, Where is their God?</hi> Joel 2.17. To conclude, the Litany, take it in the whole, and in every part of it, is ſo excellent a Form of all good devotion, that they muſt needs be upbrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded either with errour, or ſomewhat worſe, whom in all parts this principal and excellent Prayer doth not fully ſatisfie. The corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions brought into former Litanies, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Saints names, and Invocation of Saints, are purged away in ours, ſo that there is not any Litany extant more complete then ours is; the Church in other Divine Offices hath exceeded other Churches, but in this her ſelf.</p>

               <hi>Note.</hi> The four Ember weeks were anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently weeks of Abſtinence, quarterly Faſts obſerved in the four ſeaſons of the year; the Wedneſday, Friday, and Saturday after the firſt Sunday in Lent, for the Spring; the Wedneſday, Friday, and Saturday after the Feaſt of Pentecoſt, for the Summer; the Wedneſday, Friday, and Saturday after Holy
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:51624:115"/>Croſs, <hi>September</hi> the 13th. for the Autumn; and the Wedneſday, Friday, and Saturday after St. <hi>Lucies</hi> day, <hi>December</hi> the 13th. for the Winter. Now the Church enjoyned Wedneſday, Friday, and Saturday to be weekly obſerved, becauſe Chriſt was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed by <hi>Judas</hi> on a Wedneſday, was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified on a Friday, and was laid in the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre on a Saturday. And the Church en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned theſe days to be quarterly obſerved as Faſting-days, for theſe following reaſons: 1. That Chriſtians might be as devout as the <hi>Jews,</hi> who obſerved four ſeveral and ſolemn times of Faſt in the year, <hi>Zechar.</hi> 8.19. 2. Becauſe theſe are the Firſt-fruits of every Seaſon, which we rightly dedicate to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and honour of God, that beginning every Seaſon ſo devoutly, we may learn to ſpend the whole year accordingly; and that by this means we may procure Gods bleſſing upon the Fruits of the year ariſing out of the Earth, which are at theſe Seaſons either ſown, ſprung up, come to ripeneſs, or ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered into Barns. 3. That we may call our ſelves yearly to a ſtrict account for our ſins committed every Seaſon, and ſadly and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly repent of them. 4. That we may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore Gods mercy to our bodies, in freeing us from thoſe common diſtemperatures, which uſually are predominant at theſe four
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:51624:116"/>Seaſons. 5. That we may procure the greater bleſſing upon the Miniſters received into Holy Orders at theſe four Seaſons of the year, by Prayer, Faſting, and impoſition of hands. Now the forementioned weeks are called Ember weeks, from an old Saxon word <hi>Enthber,</hi> which denotes Abſtinence; or, ſay others, from the word <hi>Ember,</hi> now commonly in uſe, which ſignifies Aſhes, for Aſhes were a ceremony frequently made uſe of in times of Faſting, and carried with it ſignificancy ſufficient; from which ceremony the firſt day of the Lent-faſt, was termed <hi>Aſh-wedneſday:</hi> of which it is probable I may ſay ſomething more in proper place.</p>

Yet ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it hath pleaſed thee of thy tender mercy upon our weak and unworthy humiliation, to aſſwage the contagious ſickneſs, wherewith we lately have been ſore afflicted, and to reſtore the voice of joy and health into our dwellings; we offer unto thy divine Majeſty the ſacrifice of praiſe and thanksgiving, lauding and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying thy glorious Name for ſuch thy preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and providence over us, through Jeſus Christ our Lord. Amen.</hi>

               <hi>Note.</hi> Theſe Thankſgivings extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, anſwer moſt of them to the Prayers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary foregeing; we praiſe God in the latter, for what we prayed for in the former. They need not be Scriptured out exactly, for they are the very Scriptures themſelves, both for ground of matter, and form of words. They are of a very rational
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:51624:120"/>contrivance, for great deliverances ought to have perpetual remembrances, and the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious favours of God beſtowed upon us, are to be remembred and acknowledged with gratitude. The very Heathens in their Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories ſhew it to be uſual, and God in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by his injunction makes it neceſſary, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.9, 10. that we ſhould dutifully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pay to God our tribute of praiſe, for the great and undeſerved benefits which we have received from him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 111.4. Thus have I, for the good of the Church, (I hope) and for the glory of God, and for the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of ſome who may have prejudices againſt our publick Divine Service, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that account may abſent themſelves from it, or not joyn in it with that devotion as they ought to do; and I am ſure without making any unhandſom and uncharitable reflections (which is a very great errour of the Pen) upon any perſons whatſoever, who do but own Chriſt and God as they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in Scripture, and profeſs Chriſtianity, contributed my poor endeavours to invite ſo many in, as can be rationally moved and perſwaded, to joyn with us in our Chriſtian Aſſemblies, that we may with one heart, mind and mouth glorifie God, and ſerve him without diſtraction, who is I am ſure the God of order, and not of confuſion.</p>
